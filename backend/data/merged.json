    "Team description": "The game itself is a turn-based strategic territory control game that utilizes blockchain technology to introduce an economic layer where players stake real value into game pieces. Key features include AI-driven opponents, a cryptographic fog of war, and dynamic economic mechanics that promote long-term engagement through emergent political and social gameplay. The core innovation lies in creating perceived arbitrage opportunities for new players while employing sophisticated retention mechanisms through adversarial AI agents and economic friction systems. 100\u00d7100 coordinate grid by staking cryptocurrency. Each piece represents real economic value and can move, attack, or defend territory. The game operates on synchronized one-hour epochs, with phases for commitment, resolution, and information. Every action, such as moving or attacking, incurs a 1% fee based on the piece's staked value. Grid coordinates act as unique public wallet addresses, enabling development where any player can deposit funds to \"develop\" tiles, with the original tile holder, developer, and game treasury receiving portions of the deposits. Information asymmetry is maintained through cryptographic systems, with pieces decrypting tile information within a 2-3 coordinate radius. AI agents are integrated as economic participants with pre-existing territories and wealth, and players can even invest in their development. These AI agents collectively manage withdrawal friction through dynamic offramp systems and withdrawal penalties. The game generates revenue through various streams, including movement taxes, withdrawal penalties, development fees, map expansion fees, information services, AI licensing, and gas auction platform fees",

Additionally, Gaston will be based on the innovative Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem, guaranteeing modern, secure, and decentralized technology.## Finance made simple, for everyone.With Gaston, you'll be able to perform all your transactions in the currency or crypto of your choice, keep a detailed record of your movements organized by date, category, and more, pay for services, and make recharges directly from the app.All of this in an environment that combines an aesthetic, pleasant, and modern interface, paying close attention to user experience. Gaston is empathetic and accessible, both for people just starting in the world of finance and cryptocurrencies, and for advanced users looking for a powerful and flexible tool.## Why was Gaston born?Gaston was created in response to a common yet deeply personal challenge: the need to understand and improve financial behavior through clear, accessible analysis. The motivation behind its development was not just to track expenses, but to enable meaningful insights that support better decision-making.Existing tools in the market often fall short \u2014 offering limited functionality, poor user experience, or requiring payment for basic features. Even custom solutions like spreadsheets or dashboards lack the adaptability and depth needed for comprehensive financial management.Gaston was born from this gap. It\u2019s a solution designed to empower users with clarity, control, and confidence in their financial journey.## Who is it for?Gaston is designed for individuals seeking clarity, control, and simplicity in managing their finances. Whether dealing with traditional currencies or cryptocurrencies, users often face the challenge of organizing their financial activity in a way that is both comprehensive and intuitive. This solution is ideal for those who:- Struggle to keep track of multiple expenses across different platforms.- Have tried existing tools but found them rigid, incomplete, or overwhelming.- Need a reliable and user-friendly way to monitor, categorize, and analyze their financial movements.Gaston offers a streamlined experience for anyone looking to take meaningful steps toward better financial management \u2014 without unnecessary complexity.## Who do we compete against?In the Argentine market, there are several virtual wallets that try to occupy the financial space, but none manage to offer what Gaston promises. These are their main shortcomings:- Mercado Pago: Functional, but limited. It's designed for basic purchases and payments, without advanced tools to analyze your finances. Furthermore, it doesn't support cryptocurrencies nor does it seek to be more than an extension of the Mercado Libre ecosystem.- Modo: Depends on banks and is focused on simple transfers and payments. It lacks modern tools, cryptocurrency support, and a user experience designed for those seeking total control of their finances.- Ual\u00e1: Offers a prepaid card and basic functionalities, but lacks flexibility and depth. It doesn't support cryptocurrencies or allow advanced management of your finances.- Ual\u00e1: Offers a prepaid card and basic functionalities, but lacks flexibility and depth. It doesn't support cryptocurrencies or allow advanced management of your finances.- Binance (in Argentina): Although it has a simple mode, it remains a complex platform designed primarily for advanced users. If you're not familiar with the crypto world, it can be intimidating and inaccessible.## Why is Gaston better?Gaston not only fills the gaps left by competitors, but it does so with a solid foundation:- Leading security: It is deployed on a mainnet and operates through smart contracts in the ICP ecosystem. This ensures that your transactions are completely transparent, secure, and decentralized.- Ease of use for everyone: An intuitive and aesthetic interface, designed for both new and advanced users.

Overview### \ud83d\udccc Protocol IntroductionAs native Bitcoin DeFi continues to evolve, more and more outstanding projects are exploring how to unlock BTC's on-chain liquidity. However, we have observed that:> Despite the rapid development of this sector, there is still a **lack of a mature, native, and highly optimized BTC lending protocol** within the **ICP ecosystem**.**BLend** was created to fill this gap \u2014 aiming to become a truly BTC-focused, decentralized financial infrastructure built natively on ICP.---### \ud83d\udca1 Name Meaning: What does \u201cBLend\u201d stand for?The name *BLend* embodies the core philosophy behind our protocol:- **B** \u2192 Bitcoin, the foundational value anchor of crypto finance \u00a0- **Lend** \u2192 Lending, one of the most fundamental and widely adopted primitives in DeFi \u00a0- **Blend** \u2192 Fusion, reconstruction, and reinvention \u2014 symbolizing our reimagination of BTC utilityWith this name, we aim to express our commitment to Bitcoin: \u00a0Not just as a store of value, but as **a productive capital** in the world of DeFi.### \ud83e\udde9 Our Core Vision: What Are We Building?By deeply blending **\u201cB\u201d (Bitcoin)** and **\u201cLend\u201d (Lending)**, **BLend** aims to create a:- **Bitcoin-centric** protocol \u00a0- With **efficient lending capabilities** \u00a0- That enables **cross-chain liquidity** \u00a0- And is **trustless, verifiable, and composable**A truly native **decentralized financial infrastructure** \u2014 serving BTC users and developers, and driving the growth of Bitcoin DeFi on ICP.---## II. Core Operation Mechanism### \ud83c\udfe6 Borrowing: When You Need Extra FirepowerAt **BLend**, the interest you pay when borrowing is determined by a **Dynamic Interest Rate Model based on Utilization Rate** \u2014 fancy words for a system that adapts as more people borrow.#### \ud83d\udcd0 Utilization Rate: How \"Busy\" is the Pool?Utilization rate tells us what percentage of the liquidity in the pool has already been borrowed.&nbsp;$$U = \\frac{Total\\ Borrowed\\ Assets}{Total\\ Liquidity\\ (Borrowed + Available)}$$&nbsp;**Example:** \u00a0If the pool has a total of 100 BTC and 60 BTC have been borrowed, then the utilization rate $U = 60\\%$.&nbsp;<div align=\"center\">| Parameter \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | Value \u00a0 ||--------------------------|---------|| Base Rate \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| 1.2% \u00a0 \u00a0|| Utilization Optimal Rate | 70% \u00a0 \u00a0 || Slope 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| 2% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0|| Slope 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| 40% \u00a0 \u00a0 |</div>&nbsp;Now here's how we calculate your borrow rate, depending on how busy the pool is:#### \ud83e\uddee If $U \\leq U_{optimal}$ (i.e., the pool still has breathing room):> You're borrowing at a relatively peaceful time.$$BorrowRate = BaseRate + \\left( \\frac{U}{U_{optimal}} \\right) \\times Slope1$$#### \ud83d\udea8 If $U > U_{optimal}$ (i.e., everyone's grabbing money):> You're borrowing during rush hour, and it's gonna cost a bit more.$$BorrowRate = BaseRate + Slope1 + \\left( \\frac{U - U_{optimal}}{1 - U_{optimal}} \\right) \\times Slope2$$&nbsp;This system ensures fair pricing: \u00a0- **Low usage = low rates = good time to borrow** \u00a0- **High usage = higher rates = maybe wait or pay up**---### \ud83d\udcb0 Supply RateWhen a user supplies assets into BLend, **10% of the deposited amount** is automatically allocated to the **Reserve Pool** \u2014 a buffer designed to absorb risk for the protocol. \u00a0But don\u2019t worry \u2014 **that portion still belongs to you**, and you\u2019ll get it back when you **fully withdraw** your liquidity.Meanwhile, your **supply rate (interest earnings)** comes from the interest paid by borrowers. \u00a0After the protocol takes a small fee, the **remaining interest is proportionally distributed** to all liquidity providers based on their share in the pool.---### \ud83d\udcb8 Deposit Allocation LogicLet\u2019s say you deposit a total of:&nbsp;$$Deposit_{user} = X$$Here\u2019s how your funds are split:- **10%** \u2192 Platform reserve (risk buffer) \u00a0- **5%** \u2192 Still counted as yours, just kept in reserve \u00a0- **85%** \u2192 Actively enters the pool to earn interest \u00a0So we calculate:&nbsp;$$ReserveShare_{user} = 0.15 \\times X$$$$ActiveLiquidity_{user} = 0.85 \\times X$$When you decide to withdraw, you\u2019ll get back:&nbsp;$$Withdraw_{user} = ReserveShare_{user} + ActiveLiquidity_{user} + AccruedInterest_{user}$$---### \ud83d\udcc8 Annualized Yield per UserEach user *i* earns annually:&nbsp;$$UserEarnings_i = TotalInterest_{year} \\times (1 - ReserveFactor)$$That\u2019s it \u2014 your deposit works while you chill \ud83d\ude0e---### \ud83d\udd01 Repay (Paying Back Your Loan)\"Repay\" means returning the BTC (or any other borrowed asset) back to the lending pool \u2014 settling both the **principal + interest**, unlocking your collateral, and restoring your borrowing capacity.At **BLend**, we believe **debt should be transparent**, not buried in confusing APR/APY jargon.---### \ud83d\udc64 User Perspective1. You initiate repayment \u2014 **you\u2019ll only see ONE number** (principal + interest).2. The system **first deducts accrued interest** (`Accrued Interest`).3. Remaining amount goes toward **paying off the principal** (`Borrowed Principal`).4. Your **borrow balance and Health Factor** are updated.5. If fully repaid, your **collateral is unlocked and withdrawable**.---### \ud83d\udee0 Under the Hood (Tech Flow)1. Check that repayment amount > 0.2. Validate the asset exists in a supported lending pool.3. Fetch the **maximum repayable amount** for the user.4. Confirm the user actually has outstanding debt (> 0).5. Ensure repayment amount \u2264 outstanding loan.6. Transfer funds into the **corresponding lending pool**.7. Update the user's `borrowed` state.---### \ud83d\udcb0 Withdraw (Getting Your Assets Back)\"Withdraw\" means taking out your supplied BTC (or other assets), along with the **interest you've earned** \u2014 either partially or in full.---### \ud83d\udc64 User Flow1. User initiates a `Withdraw` action \u2014 partial or full.2. Protocol calculates how much you can withdraw:\u00a0 \u00a0- Your **original deposit**\u00a0 \u00a0- Your **accrued interest** (`Accrued Interest`)3. If pool has enough liquidity \u2192 **instant payout** \ud83d\udfe24. If your request exceeds available funds \u2192 system enables **Slow Withdraw Mode\u2122** \ud83d\udc22 (more on that later)5. Once processed, your **supply status is updated** accordingly.---> \u26fd\ufe0f TL;DR: Repay clears your debt, Withdraw reclaims your assets. BLend ensures both are smooth, transparent, and user-first.### \ud83d\udca5 Liquidation MechanismWhen a borrower\u2019s collateral value drops \u2014 or the borrowed amount becomes too large \u2014 the system must step in to **partially or fully close the borrower\u2019s position** to prevent losses. \u00a0This process is called **Liquidation**.#### \ud83c\udfaf Purpose of Liquidation- \u26d4 Prevent bad debt from hurting the protocol \u00a0- \ud83e\uddee Recover the debt by auctioning or discount-selling collateral \u00a0- \ud83d\udd10 Ensure overall system health and protect depositors\u2019 funds \u00a0> \ud83d\udca1 Liquidation is a **core risk management mechanism** in any DeFi lending protocol.---| Parameter \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| Description \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | ICP \u00a0 | BTC/ETH | USDC \u00a0||---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|--------|| **Collateral Factor** \u00a0 \u00a0 | Portion of collateral value allowed to be borrowed \u00a0 \u00a0| 0.75 \u00a0| 0.70 \u00a0 \u00a0| 0.80 \u00a0 || **Liquidation Threshold** | Max borrowing ratio before triggering liquidation \u00a0 \u00a0 | 0.80 \u00a0| 0.75 \u00a0 \u00a0| 0.85 \u00a0 || **Liquidation Bonus** \u00a0 \u00a0 | Discount (bonus) granted to the liquidator \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| 0.05 \u00a0| 0.05 \u00a0 \u00a0| 0.05 \u00a0 |### \ud83e\uddea Health Factor (HF)The **Health Factor (HF)** is like your wallet\u2019s cholesterol level \u2014 \u00a0a quick check to see if your position is healthy or on the verge of collapse \ud83e\udee3.It's calculated as:$$HF = \\frac{\\text{Collateral Value} \\times \\text{Liquidation Threshold}}{\\text{Borrowed Amount} + \\text{Accrued Interest}}$$- If **HF \u2265 1**: You're good! Your account is healthy and safe \ud83d\udfe2 \u00a0- If **HF < 1**: Danger zone! You\u2019re undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation \ud83d\udd25---### \ud83d\udcca Health Factor with Multiple Collateral AssetsMost users don\u2019t just deposit one coin, so let\u2019s talk multi-asset portfolios.When you deposit multiple types of collateral (e.g., ICP, BTC, ETH), \u00a0your **overall Health Factor** is calculated like this:$$HF = \\frac{\\sum_i (\\text{Collateral}_i \\times \\text{Price}_i \\times \\text{LiquidationThreshold}_i)}{\\sum_j (\\text{Debt}_j + \\text{AccruedInterest}_j)}$$In plain English:- **Numerator** = Your total collateral value, *adjusted for each asset\u2019s liquidation threshold* \u00a0- **Denominator** = Everything you owe: principal + all accumulated interest \u00a0> The higher your HF, the safer your position. Think of it as your DeFi \"credit score\" \u2014 and yes, we\u2019re watching it in real time \ud83d\udc40.## \ud83d\udd25 Liquidation Flow (Simplified Version)1. Anyone spots an account with a **Health Factor (HF) < 1** \u2014 Uh-oh!2. The liquidation process kicks in, allowing **liquidators** to repay the borrower\u2019s debt.3. In return, liquidators get the borrower\u2019s collateral at a **discounted price**.4. The borrower's account is fully liquidated, and the HF bounces back to a safe level.> \u26a0\ufe0f For now, we only support **full liquidation** \u2014 liquidators must repay the entire debt at once. \u00a0> Future versions will allow **partial liquidation**. If HF remains unsafe after liquidation, the system will continue zapping the account until it\u2019s either empty or healthy.---### \ud83d\udc64 Borrower's POV: \u201cWait, what just happened?\u201d- You borrowed some assets. The system tracks your **Health Factor** in real time.- Then BTC price drops. Uh-oh \u2014 your collateral value just shrank.- Once HF < 1, the protocol **sells your collateral to a liquidator** (at a discount).- You lose part of your collateral and pay the price \u2014 literally \u2014 via liquidation penalties.- \u2705 Pro tip: Top up or repay when HF gets close to 1 to avoid the axe.---### \ud83e\uddbe Liquidator's POV: \u201cHow do I make money here?\u201d- Liquidators repay a portion (or all) of someone else's bad debt.- In return, they get **collateral at a discount (5%\u201310%)** \u2014 sweet deal.- Example:\u00a0 - You repay debt worth 1 BTC.\u00a0 - The system gives you 1.1 BTC worth of collateral.\u00a0 - \ud83d\udcb0 You pocket 0.1 BTC profit \u2014 not bad for some DeFi hustle!> \ud83d\udccc Different assets have different liquidation bonuses. \u00a0> For maximum incentive, **BTC gives the highest reward: 10%** \u2014 because it\u2019s king \ud83d\udc51.## II. \ud83e\udded User Guide### \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started![Internet Identity Login Interface](picture/ICP_login.png)<p align=\"center\">Internet Identity Login Interface</p>First, create your own **Internet Identity** \u2014 your key to accessing everything in BLend. \u00a0Once that\u2019s done, you\u2019re ready to dive in and start exploring!---### \u2699\ufe0f Core Operations#### \ud83d\udcb0 Supplying / Depositing Assets- Head over to the **\u201cEarnings\u201d** page.

Once you clear your debt, your collateral is **automatically unlocked and ready for withdrawal**. \ud83c\udf89---## III. \ud83e\udde0 Protocol Mechanics (For Developers / Power Users)### \ud83d\udee0 Supply Logic (Developer View)When a user supplies assets to the protocol, the following steps are executed under the hood:1. **Validate input amount** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ensure `NumTokens > 0` \u2014 zero is not a valid deposit.2. **Verify pool existence** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Confirm that a pool corresponding to the specified `token_id` exists.3. **Check pool capacity** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ensure that the pool has enough room: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0`(Max Pool Capacity - Current Pool Balance) \u2265 NumTokens`.4. **Update pool balance** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Add the supplied tokens to the pool.5. **Record user deposit** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Update the user's supply record and the pool\u2019s token capacity accordingly.### \ud83d\udee0 Borrow LogicWhen a user tries to borrow some tokens, we don\u2019t just throw the money at them \u2014 here\u2019s what actually happens:1. **Check if the user wants *more than zero*** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Because borrowing 0 tokens is just... philosophical. We need `NumTokens > 0`.2. **Validate the token pool exists** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ensure there's a lending pool for the given `token_id`. If not, no tokens for you.3. **Check if the user has legit collateral** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0User must have deposited accepted assets (like ICP, BTC, ETH, USDC). No imaginary coins allowed.4. **Calculate max borrowable amount** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Based on deposited collateral, price feeds, liquidation thresholds, and protocol parameters, we compute how much the user *can* borrow \u2014 safely.5. **Ensure the user isn\u2019t trying to YOLO too much** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The requested `NumTokens` must be \u2264 `MaxBorrowableAmount`. Over-borrowing gets rejected.6. **Transfer funds from the pool** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If the pool has enough liquidity, we send the tokens to the user. It's like a payday, except you owe us.7. **Update the borrow record** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We update the user's borrow balance, interest tracking, and health factor. Basically: \u201cCongrats, you're now officially in debt.\u201d### \ud83d\udd01 Repay Logic When a user wants to repay their loan \u2014 great! But we still need to verify they\u2019re not just clicking buttons for fun.Here\u2019s what happens under the hood:1. **Check if the user actually typed a number > 0** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0`NumTokens > 0` \u2014 we don\u2019t process fake generosity.2. **Confirm there's a valid lending pool for the given token** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If this token isn't borrowable, repayment is meaningless.3. **Verify the user really has a loan to repay** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0No borrow history? No repayment needed. Don\u2019t pretend to be responsible.4. **Calculate the max repayable amount** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This includes all unpaid principal and accrued interest. Know your total tab.5. **Ensure the user isn\u2019t trying to over-repay** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0`NumTokens` must be less than or equal to what they actually owe. No donations accepted.6. **Send the repayment back to the pool** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We split it into interest and principal. The pool says: \u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d7. **Update borrow rate if utilization has changed** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Since repayment affects utilization, we recalculate the interest rate accordingly.8. **Update the user\u2019s borrow record** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0New debt balance, reduced interest accumulation, and a better health factor. You're less likely to be liquidated \u2014 yay!### \ud83c\udfe7 Withdraw1. **Check the amount**: Make sure `Numtokens > 0`. No ghost withdrawals allowed.2. **Validate the pool**: Ensure there's a pool that supports the given token ID.3. **Verify ownership**: Confirm that the user actually has a deposit in this pool.4. **Calculate max withdrawable amount**: Based on user's supply minus any borrowed amounts.5. **Validate input**: Make sure `Numtokens <= max withdrawable amount`. No magic tricks.6. **Check liquidity**: Ensure the pool has enough unborrowed tokens to meet the request.7. **Transfer funds**: Send the appropriate amount from the pool back to the user.8. **Update records**: Adjust the user's supply balance and pool's total state.### \ud83d\udca5 Liquidate (Liquidation Mechanism)When a borrower's health factor falls below the protocol-defined threshold, third-party liquidators are allowed to repay the borrower's debt and acquire a portion of their collateral. The following outlines the standardized liquidation flow:1. **Verify Borrower Existence** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ensure the target address is a valid user and has outstanding debt recorded in the system.2. **Calculate Health Factor** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Evaluate the borrower's account by computing the Health Factor using the formula: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*(Collateral Value \u00d7 Liquidation Threshold) / (Borrowed Amount + Accrued Interest)*. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If **Health Factor < 1**, liquidation is permitted.3. **Determine Liquidation Payment Amount** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Calculate the total repayment amount required from the liquidator to cover the borrower's current debt. This typically includes both principal and accrued interest.4. **Calculate Maximum Collateral Transferable to Liquidator** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Based on the protocol's liquidation bonus rate, determine the maximum value of collateral that can be seized by the liquidator at a discounted rate.5. **Execute Liquidation** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The liquidator repays part or all of the borrower's outstanding debt. In return, the corresponding portion of collateral is transferred to the liquidator, according to the protocol-defined rules.6. **Update System States** \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The system updates the borrower's `borrow` and `supply` balances, and reflects changes in the pool\u2019s available liquidity and total reserves.```",

Instead of on-demand gaming, it follows a TVshow format with set broadcast times, creating anticipation and bringing people together at specific moments.  Plans to extend it include live, onchain leaderboards, and the ability to reward prizes to the winners.It's built on blockchain technology for decentralised hosting and secure authentication, making it censorship-resistant and globally accessible without relying on traditional servers or payment systems.Generally, the project can be used by other groups/companies/projects to educate, onboard and engage their community in a fun, yet informing, way.We are building this for Lift.Cash and our growing community to help onboard them, plans to extend this with prizes can help keep our participants engaged over time, and new articles and media can fuel new Trivia contests.For Lift.Cash, we are building a democratic economic system, and as democracy requires an educated voter base to be effective, we wish to leverage this Trivia dApp to ensure that members in our community stay informed and become valued stewards of this economic system.",

    "Team description": "### **The Problem**Digital assets today are fragmented across Web2 platforms, storage layers, and different blockchains with no unified means to govern or verify them. Furthermore, they are often effectively owned by the platforms that serve them, rather than by the creators, institutions, or communities they represent. As a result, they remain restricted and isolated within their respective systems, and this fragmentation locks innovation in silos while centralized platforms reap the rewards.\u00a0 Ultimately, the management of these fractured assets has prolonged the dominance of Web2 and strangled the promises of Web3 through the absence of a true alternative\u2026 until now.### **The Solution**The Constellation Protocol introduces a new kind of digital object: the dynamic federated asset; where all of the different instances form a decentralized whole.\u00a0 At its core is a smart canister on the Internet Computer, which is not just a contract, but the true identity and governing source of the asset. This canister:- Serves the asset itself (a song, 3D file, PDF, etc.) via HTTP with built-in encryption and access control- Governs licensing, access, and custodianship- Deploys, connects to, and manages external instances on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more chains in the future\u00a0\u00a0- Seamlessly integrates with Web2 platforms, enabling asset access, embedding, and downloads without requiring wallets or Web3 knowledge- Tracks the entirety of the asset\u2019s provenance and all of its instances using the ICRC-3 standard- Allows role-based updates and decentralized governanceThe core of the system is that each instance of a digital asset - be it an ERC-721 NFT on Ethereum, a compressed NFT (cNFT) on Solana, or a direct Web2 file embed - becomes like a star within a larger constellation\u2026 with the ICP canister serving as the entity that maps them all together into a coherent whole.**Why It Matters**Digital assets have long been caught between usability and control. Web2 platforms offer convenience where files can be viewed, downloaded, or embedded, yet ownership and governance are surrendered to the platforms themselves. Web3 flips the script with decentralization and self-sovereignty, but often introduces friction, fragmentation, and isolation across chains and protocols with poor user interface.\u00a0\u00a0The Constellation Protocol bridges these two worlds. At its core is a smart canister that serves as the asset\u2019s true identity: a Web2-compatible interface that can deliver encrypted files via HTTP, while also acting as the authoritative manager of the asset\u2019s representations across Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and beyond. Licensing, access, updates, and governance are handled by the canister itself, and governance of said canister can be managed by an individual, a collective, or a DAO.Critical to the infrastructure, however, is that the canister doesn\u2019t just reference other blockchain representations - it actually deploys and owns them.\u00a0 Further, it is the canister\u2019s ID that is minted on these other chains, which makes it more than metadata, and so much more than just a pointer to where the data is actually hosted.\u00a0 Indeed, it\u2019s the actual asset that is minted on chain.The canister ID thus becomes something like a living CID, or perhaps a dynamic, next-generation DOI. It anchors the asset\u2019s entire lifecycle across chains, standards, and storage layers. Using ICRC-3, it maintains a verifiable history of the asset and all its linked instances (stars) both on-chain and off-chain.\u00a0 And based on ICP\u2019s built-in HTTP calls, it means that the canister is also effectively an oracle that can report to other chains, track on-chain changes, and connect to Web2 services through native HTTP without relying on third-party bridges or middleware.As such, one of the greatest hurdles to Web3 adoption and scaling - that of interoperability - is built in as the foundation of The Constellation Protocol.\u00a0 The result is a single, governable digital asset that lives across ecosystems while staying connected to a unified source of truth. In all, it\u2019s a fundamental rethinking of how digital assets are created, governed, and experienced.**What We Have**Core Infrastructure- Galaxy Canister: A fully functional Rust-based canister that serves as the central coordinator for cross-chain asset management- Constellation Canister: A comprehensive HTTP-serving canister that implements ICRC-3 ledger functionality, provides encrypted asset storage, and manages cross-chain authentication- EVM RPC Integration: Seamless Ethereum connectivity using the official EVM RPC canister (7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai), currently configured for Base Sepolia testnet, but compatible with any EVM compatible chain- SIWE Authentication: Complete Sign-In with Ethereum integration using the official SIWE provider canister for cross-chain identity managementCross-Chain Functionality- Ethereum Integration: Full ERC-1155 contract deployment and token minting capabilities with ic-alloy for threshold cryptography- Multi-Network Support: Configurable RPC endpoints for Base Sepolia testnet, with extensible architecture for additional networks- Asset Mapping System: Stable storage for tracking asset relationships across different blockchain representations- Cross-Chain Ownership Verification: Real-time token ownership validation across Ethereum and Internet ComputerICRC-3 Implementation- Complete ICRC-3 Ledger: custom implementation of the ICRC-3 standard for immutable asset tracking and certification- Block Management: Add, retrieve, and verify blocks with comprehensive metadata tracking- Chain Integrity Verification: Cryptographic verification of asset provenance and history- Genesis Block Initialization: Automated provisioning of new asset canisters with integrated cross-chain metadata and configurable initialization logicHTTP Asset Serving- Certified HTTP Endpoints: IC-certified asset delivery with built-in encryption and access control- Range Request Support: Efficient large file delivery with partial content support for 3D models, videos, and other large assets- Metadata Management: JSON-based metadata storage and retrieval with public access patternsFrontend Architecture- React TypeScript Framework: Modern, type-safe frontend with comprehensive component library- Web3 Integration: RainbowKit and Wagmi for multi-chain wallet connections- IC Agent Integration: Native Internet Computer connectivity with SIWE authentication- Lit Protocol: Encryption and access control for sensitive asset data based on token ownership- Shared Component Library: Reusable UI components for consistent cross-platform experienceProduction-Ready Features- Stable Storage: Persistent data management using IC stable structures- Error Handling: Comprehensive error management across all cross-chain operations- Security: Controller-based access control and SIWE authentication- Scalability: Modular canister architecture supporting multiple asset types and networksCurrent Capabilities- Deploy new assets across Ethereum and Internet Computer simultaneously- Mint ERC-1155 tokens with canister ID as the token identifier- Serve encrypted assets via HTTP with IC certification- Track complete asset provenance using ICRC-3- Verify cross-chain ownership\u00a0**What\u2019s To Come**Solana Integration: Extend cross-chain functionality to include Solana-native assets and smart contract interoperabilityModular Frontend Framework: Develop a reusable React-based interface adaptable for various asset types, user roles, and organizational needsEnhanced Encryption & Identity: Incorporate vetKeys for advanced encryption, secure asset access, and seamless integration with Internet IdentityToken Standard Upgrade: Transition from current token architecture to the ICRC-7 standard to support advanced metadata, multi-asset capabilities, and richer interoperabilityDecentralized Indexing Layer: Design and implement an indexing system to query and discover federated assets across canisters and chains in a verifiable, censorship-resistant mannerMulti-Orchestrator Support: Enable a network of orchestrator canisters to manage asset domains across institutions or organizations, fostering collaborative custodianship and redundancyGovernance Toolkits: Build governance modules enabling DAOs or collectives to co-manage asset permissions, royalties, and update rights using token-based or multi-sig modelsOpen Standardization Effort: Initiate or contribute to standards bodies (e.g. ICRC, W3C) to formalize federated asset protocols and metadata schemasCustom Contract Support: Expand beyond the current default ERC-1155 implementation by enabling the upload, registration, and management of custom EVM-compatible contracts, allowing tailored logic and diverse token standards within the federated asset system",

Welcome to VeriPact, a project born from a simple yet powerful idea: to make giving honest again.### The Problem: The Crisis of Trust in CharityTraditional philanthropy is often a black box. High administrative fees, a lack of transparency, and occasional scandals have created deep-seated mistrust. Donors are left in the dark, questioning if their contributions truly make the impact they intended. This uncertainty discourages giving and hinders the incredible work that needs to be done.### Our Solution: A Pact of Trust on the Blockchain**VeriPact** is a decentralized social donation platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP), designed to restore faith in giving. We are not another intermediary; we are a transparent vessel. Think of it as a \"digital charity box\" that is collectively owned and operated by its community of donors.### How It WorksOur platform is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), ensuring power remains with the community, not a central authority.1. **Secure Digital Treasury:** All donations are sent directly to a secure on-chain smart contract (a 'canister' on ICP), not a private bank account. The funds are locked and governed by code.2. **Open Proposal System:** Individuals or organizations in need of funding can submit public proposals directly to the DAO, outlining their cause, goals, and budget.3. **Donor-Led Governance:** Every donation grants you voting power. As a donor, you get to directly vote on which proposals deserve funding. Your voice truly matters.4. **Radical Transparency:** Every single transaction\u2014from the moment a donation is made to the moment funds are disbursed to a successful proposal\u2014is immutably recorded on the blockchain. It's publicly auditable by anyone, at any time. Zero ambiguity. Zero chance for fraud.### Why the Internet Computer (ICP)?We chose the Internet Computer for its unique ability to host complex applications entirely on-chain. Its incredible speed, low transaction costs (thanks to the reverse-gas model), and robust security provide the perfect foundation for a platform like VeriPact. This allows us to operate efficiently and affordably, ensuring that the maximum value of every donation goes directly to the intended cause.### Our VisionWe are building more than just a platform; we are building an ecosystem of verifiable trust. VeriPact aims to revolutionize philanthropy by making it transparent, democratic, and profoundly impactful.**Join us in forging an unbreakable pact of trust in giving.**",

    "Team description": "Dcanary is a decentralized, verifiable Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system built specifically to operate on and for the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain. It fundamentally re-imagines the software delivery pipeline for the Web3 era by replacing the centralized, trust-based model of traditional platforms like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI with a trustless, cryptographically verifiable, and unstoppable on-chain protocol.#### The Core Problem: The Trust Gap in Decentralized SoftwareIn the high-stakes world of decentralized applications, where smart contracts can manage millions of dollars, the principle is\u00a0**\"Don't Trust, Verify.\"**\u00a0However, traditional CI/CD systems introduce a massive blind spot: the build process. When a developer pushes code, a centralized server compiles it and deploys it. Users and developers alike are forced to\u00a0trust\u00a0that this centralized server has not been compromised and has not injected malicious code into the final on-chain artifact. This \"trust gap\" between the audited public source code and the deployed on-chain code is a critical vulnerability. Dcanary's entire existence is dedicated to closing this gap.#### The Dcanary Solution: Verifiable Builds Through On-Chain ConsensusDcanary's solution is to treat the CI/CD pipeline itself as a decentralized application. It moves the most critical parts of the pipeline\u2014orchestration, configuration, and verification\u2014onto the Internet Computer as a set of interoperable smart contracts (canisters).The \"magic\" lies in its\u00a0**consensus-based verification model**. Instead of one trusted server building the code, Dcanary tasks multiple, independent, off-chain \"executor agents\" to perform the exact same build in parallel. Each agent computes a cryptographic hash (a unique fingerprint) of the final compiled code. These hashes are reported back to the on-chain Verification Canister. If a sufficient majority of the agents report the\u00a0exact same hash, the build is cryptographically proven to be correct and untampered with.This model brilliantly transforms the build process from a black box into a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized protocol.#### Architectural Deep Dive: The ComponentsDcanary employs a sophisticated microservices-style architecture composed of on-chain canisters and off-chain components.**1. The On-Chain Canister System (The Decentralized Backend)**This is the heart and brain of Dcanary, living entirely on the Internet Computer.- **Webhook Canister (webhook_canister.ts):**\u00a0This is the on-chain entrypoint. It listens for triggers from the outside world (like a\u00a0git push\u00a0event forwarded by an off-chain handler). It manages repository configurations and initiates the pipeline workflow.- **Pipeline Config / Build Instructions Canister (index.ts):**\u00a0This canister acts as an immutable, on-chain database for \"build recipes.\" It securely stores the sequence of commands (npm install,\u00a0cargo build, etc.) for each project. As seen in its\u00a0validateInput\u00a0function, it contains robust security measures to prevent the storage of dangerous or malicious scripts.- **Verification Canister (verification_canister.ts):**\u00a0This is the central orchestrator and the most complex component. When a pipeline is triggered, this canister:    1. Fetches the correct pipeline configuration and build instructions.    2. Dispatches the build job to multiple registered\u00a0Build Executor\u00a0agents.    3. Manages the state of the active verification, including timers and polling for results.    4. Performs the final\u00a0**consensus check**\u00a0on the returned hashes.    5. Manages advanced features like multi-stage pipelines, quality gates, and deployment approvals.- **Deployment Canister (deployment_canister.ts):**\u00a0Once a build is successfully verified by consensus, this canister takes over. It manages the final step of deploying the Wasm file to the Internet Computer, handling different network targets (local, IC mainnet), deployment strategies (install, upgrade), and cycles management.- **Build Executor Canister (build_executor.ts):**\u00a0This on-chain canister serves as a lightweight proxy or interface for its off-chain counterpart. It holds the state for a specific build job and is the contract that the off-chain agent communicates with to report its results.**2. The Off-Chain Executor Agent (off-chain-agent/)**This is the \"muscle\" of the system and the answer to how Dcanary handles complex builds using tools like Docker. It is a separate piece of software designed to run on traditional infrastructure (e.g., an AWS EC2 instance, a local server). Its responsibilities are:1. Listen for new jobs dispatched by the on-chain Verification Canister.2. Spin up a clean, ephemeral Docker container based on the project's requirements.3. Execute the build instructions\u00a0inside\u00a0this isolated container.4. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the resulting artifacts.5. Report the hash and status back to its corresponding on-chain canister.**3. The Command-Line Interface (CLI) (@dcanary/cli)**This is the primary user interface for developers. The powerful\u00a0dcanary\u00a0command allows users to:- init: Initialize Dcanary in a project, creating the\u00a0dcanary.json\u00a0manifest.- pipeline: Create and manage multi-stage pipeline configurations.- integrate: Connect to SCM providers like GitHub to set up webhooks.- build: Trigger a local test build.- deploy: Manually trigger a verified deployment.#### End-to-End Workflow: From\u00a0git push\u00a0to Deployment1. **Trigger:**\u00a0A developer pushes code to their GitHub repository.2. **Webhook:**\u00a0GitHub sends a webhook to Dcanary's off-chain handler, which securely forwards the trigger to the on-chain\u00a0Webhook Canister.3. **Orchestration:**\u00a0The\u00a0Webhook Canister\u00a0triggers the\u00a0Verification Canister.4. **Execution Dispatch:**\u00a0The\u00a0Verification Canister\u00a0fetches the pipeline configuration and tasks multiple off-chain Executor Agents with the build job.5. **Build & Hash:**\u00a0Each agent independently builds the code in a Docker container and reports its resulting hash to the IC.6. **Consensus:**\u00a0The\u00a0Verification Canister\u00a0compares the hashes. If they match and pass the consensus threshold, the build is marked \"Verified.\"7. **Deployment:**\u00a0If the pipeline includes a deployment stage, the\u00a0Verification Canister\u00a0triggers the\u00a0Deployment Canister, which installs the verified Wasm onto the Internet Computer.8. **Audit Trail:**\u00a0The entire process, including the consensus result and final artifact hash, is immutably recorded on-chain.In essence, Dcanary is a complete, end-to-end solution that brings the core principles of decentralization, transparency, and verifiability to the practice of software development itself, solving one of the most critical trust problems in the blockchain space.",

    "Team description": "**Project Title: TurnX \u2013 Decentralized TURN Relay Coordination Layer for WebRTC****Problem Statement:**WebRTC enables real-time peer-to-peer communication, but in many regions, especially behind strict firewalls or NAT, users rely on TURN servers to relay traffic. These servers today are centralized, expensive, and capable of logging or manipulating sensitive data, violating privacy and opening users to surveillance or censorship. There is also no incentive for independent infrastructure providers to contribute to this critical layer of internet connectivity in a decentralized way.**Solution Overview:**TurnX is a decentralized coordination layer for TURN servers, built on the Internet Computer Protocol. Users requesting a video or voice call are assigned to a TURN node by a smart contract, which selects from a network of registered providers. Each provider runs a lightweight agent written in Rust that guarantees it will not log or interfere with data. The agent supports cryptographic attestations or proof-of-integrity checks, allowing the TurnX backend to verify the honesty of the relay behavior during and after the session. The system preserves full end-to-end encryption, enforces accountability, and eliminates the need to trust the provider.**Why ICP Enables This Uniquely:**ICP is the only chain that allows this to work fully on-chain. It provides low-latency, real-time coordination through canister smart contracts and inter-canister messaging. With HTTP outcalls, the contract can ping and validate TURN nodes directly without oracles. Internet Identity allows users to authenticate anonymously but verifiably. Cycle-based billing enables per-session metering and payment for relay services. The cryptographic integrity of the relay session is anchored by periodic attestations collected and verified on-chain, all within the same trust boundary.**Tokenomics Model:**TurnX introduces the TXN token as a utility and settlement layer. Users pay per-minute fees in TXN or cycles when using relay services. TURN node providers are rewarded automatically at the end of each verified session. Their rewards scale with uptime, relay quality, and successful attestation verification. If a node fails to pass attestation or is caught misbehaving, it is automatically slashed or blacklisted by the coordination canister. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where the code, not human intervention, governs trust and rewards.**Impact and Potential:**TurnX enables a global mesh of decentralized TURN relays that anyone can join and be paid for running. It restores privacy and censorship resistance to WebRTC infrastructure, while introducing transparent pricing and accountability. Future expansions include integration with dVPN services, token-gated conferencing, anonymous telemedicine, and pay-per-minute educational calls.All powered by a fully trustless, automated, and AI-verified TURN network.",

Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with `lost-pet-finder`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```bashcd lost-pet-finder/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```bash# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```bashnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor# lost-pet-finder# lost-pet-finder",

    "Team description": "AgricFi is an innovative blockchain-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional agriculture and decentralized finance (DeFi). By integrating smart contracts, tokenized assets, and transparent supply chain management, AgricFi empowers farmers, investors, and stakeholders to create a more efficient, transparent, and profitable agricultural ecosystem.The global agricultural industry generates over $10 trillion annually and supports billions of people. Yet, many farmers face challenges accessing capital, fair market pricing, and modern financial tools. AgricFi seeks to solve these issues by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, secure, and inclusive ecosystem that transforms how agricultural investments and operations are managed.Our approach not only provides the necessary tools for financial inclusion but also enables investors worldwide to participate in real-world farming projects. This whitepaper details our vision, technology, and the economic models behind AgricFi.2. Vision and MissionVision:To create a blockchain-powered agricultural ecosystem that fosters financial inclusion, transparency, and sustainable farming practices.Mission:1. To connect traditional farming with blockchain-based financial solutions:Traditional farming often depends on banks, cooperatives, and government subsidies, which can be slow, inefficient, and opaque. AgricFi replaces these outdated systems with a decentralized funding model, enabling farmers to access capital directly from global investors through automated smart contracts. This ensures a trustless, transparent funding mechanism that benefits both farmers and investors.2. To provide farmers with access to decentralized funding:Many smallholder farmers struggle to secure loans due to a lack of collateral and credit history. AgricFi\u2019s DeFi lending system allows farmers to tokenize their assets and secure funds without intermediaries, reducing costs and time delays. This model is designed to stimulate growth and innovation on the farm level.3. To create a transparent investment model with real-time tracking:Investors need assurance that their funds are used effectively. AgricFi employs blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger to record every transaction and update, offering investors a real-time dashboard to monitor farm performance, yield data, and revenue distribution.4. To tokenize agricultural produce and farmland assets:By converting physical farms and produce into digital tokens, AgricFi allows fractional ownership and trade of agricultural assets. For example, a 100-hectare farm can be tokenized into 100,000 AFT tokens, enabling a broader range of investors to participate in the agricultural market.3. The Problem StatementTraditional agriculture is plagued by several critical issues:Limited Access to Funding:Many farmers, particularly in rural and developing regions, lack the means to secure loans from traditional banks due to high collateral requirements and stringent credit criteria. This funding gap restricts their ability to invest in improved technology, quality seeds, and infrastructure.Middlemen Exploitation:The presence of intermediaries in the agricultural supply chain means that a significant portion of the revenue is siphoned off before reaching the primary producers. Farmers often receive only a fraction of the market price, while middlemen capture the bulk of the profit.Lack of Transparency in Supply Chains:Without modern tracking and management systems, agricultural supply chains suffer from inefficiencies and fraud. Buyers often lack visibility into the origin and quality of produce, leading to mistrust and suboptimal pricing.Investor Hesitancy:Agriculture is traditionally seen as a high-risk investment due to factors like weather volatility, fluctuating market prices, and lack of reliable data. This deters many potential investors from engaging in the sector.Inefficient Record-Keeping:Traditional methods do not leverage technology to document farming activities, leading to disputes and loss of accountability. This hinders the ability to provide accurate yield estimates and financial reporting.4. The AgricFi SolutionAgricFi addresses these issues through a multi-faceted, blockchain-based ecosystem that provides:Decentralized Funding:Farmers gain access to funding via tokenized assets and DeFi lending pools, bypassing traditional financial institutions and their inherent inefficiencies.Smart Contracts for Transparency:All financial transactions, funding disbursements, and profit-sharing agreements are automated via smart contracts. These contracts ensure that funds are released based on pre-defined milestones, reducing fraud and eliminating intermediaries.Tokenized Agricultural Assets:Physical assets\u2014such as farmlands and crop yields\u2014are converted into NFTs or digital tokens, allowing fractional ownership and liquidity. Investors can purchase these tokens to support farming projects and earn returns on their investments.Real-Time Tracking:By integrating IoT sensors and blockchain reporting, AgricFi offers a real-time view of farm performance. This includes yield forecasts, environmental data, and financial metrics, providing complete transparency for all stakeholders.Revenue Sharing:Investors earn a share of the profits from tokenized farms. This is achieved through a revenue-sharing model where returns are distributed proportionally based on investment, ensuring a sustainable income stream.5. Blockchain Integration with AgricultureAgricFi harnesses blockchain technology to modernize agriculture. Key components include:Smart Contracts:Automate and enforce agreements between farmers and investors, ensuring funds are used appropriately. For instance, funds are released only when a crop reaches a certain growth milestone, verified by IoT sensors.Tokenization of Assets:Farms and crops are converted into digital tokens. Each token represents a fractional share of a physical asset, enabling investors to participate in agricultural growth without owning entire farms.Immutable Record-Keeping:Every transaction, from seed purchase to crop sale, is recorded on the blockchain. This ensures data integrity, prevents tampering, and builds trust among all parties involved.Decentralized Investment Pools:Investors can join pooled funding initiatives where their money is collectively used to finance farming projects. Returns are then distributed automatically based on smart contract rules.Real-Time Monitoring:Integration with IoT and satellite technology allows continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and crop health. This data is logged on the blockchain, ensuring that investors have access to accurate, verifiable information.Example Use Case:A farmer tokenizes a 100-hectare maize farm into 100,000 AFT tokens. Investors purchase these tokens to finance the farm\u2019s operations. As the farm grows, IoT sensors track yield and environmental data, and profits from the maize sales are automatically distributed to AFT holders through smart contracts.",

    "Team description": "Our concept bridges the physical and digital worlds by integrating the Internet of Buildings (IoB) protocol with the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. We envision a system where every physical object in the built environment - buildings, rooms, components, even materials - is mapped to a unique digital representation on-chain. This mapping uses IoB\u2019s globally unique identifiers (UUIDs) and federated discovery system to create trustable, traceable references for each asset. Once registered, these objects can become smart, autonomous actors within decentralized applications on ICP. This allows real-world assets to trigger and participate in transactions, access controls, maintenance logs, and carbon tracking, all secured by ICP blockchain. Through this interface, users can interact directly with physical spaces and components as programmable digital entities. The result is a frictionless link between asset data, user interaction, and verifiable, real-time outcomes.In the long term, this lays the groundwork for the largest wave of tokenization in the built world - down to the most granular level possible. Every brick, panel, pipe, and sensor can be uniquely represented, transacted, and reused across ecosystems. Owners and developers can issue tokens for components, attach usage rights or warranties, and trade verified materials in secondary markets. Circular economy workflows become fully transparent and AI-ready, reducing waste and creating new asset classes. The protocol\u2019s open, permissionless architecture ensures that no single vendor can lock users in, while the ICP blockchain guarantees security, scalability, and cost-efficiency. Our project unleashes the potential of a composable, interoperable building stack where value, function, and sustainability are encoded into every object. This is not just smart buildings - it\u2019s programmable infrastructure on a planetary scale.",

Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with `ModelX`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```bashcd ModelX/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```bash# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```bashnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor# DevCode",

By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with `HBT_ticketing_system`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```bashcd HBT_ticketing_system/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```bash# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```bashnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor# HBT-ticket-Project2",

They face real challenges like:- Unpredictable rainfall or dry spells.- Poor yield from planting crops at the wrong time.- Zero access to data-driven tools for planning.- No ownership or control over their farm data.These farmers are disconnected from modern Agri-Tech innovations simply because they can\u2019t afford expensive platforms or don\u2019t have consistent internet connectivity.### **Our Solution: SmartSeason \u2013 A Weather-Linked Crop Planner Powered by ICP**SmartSeason is a **decentralized, low-cost IoT + Web3 system** that helps farmers make smarter decisions by combining **local weather sensing** with **on-chain crop intelligence**. It\u2019s built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** to deliver a fast, secure, and decentralized backend, without reliance on private cloud servers.### **Key Features :**- **Low-Cost Weather IoT Device** ESP32-based sensor stations collect real-time data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) from each farm.- **Offline-First Sync** Data is stored locally and synced to ICP when connectivity is available, solving rural internet limitations.- **Smart Canister Backend on ICP** Weather and forecast data are processed in ICP canisters to recommend the best planting and irrigation times.- **Localized Crop Logic** The system uses region-specific crop datasets to match conditions with optimal sowing periods.- **Mobile Dashboard (or SMS Alerts)** Farmers receive personalized suggestions in their local language via a simple app, SMS, or voice prompt.- **Data Ownership & Privacy** All weather and crop data belong to the farmer. Nothing is stored on centralized corporate servers.- **Gasless Experience** Thanks to ICP\u2019s **reverse-gas model**, farmers never have to pay transaction fees to use the service.- **Future-Ready: Tokenized Insights** As more farmers come online, anonymized data can be tokenized, allowing farmers to earn or access better analytics.### \u00a0**Impact Potential :**- Empowers **smallholder farmers** with predictive insights at no extra cost.- Increases crop yield and reduces losses due to mistimed planting- Builds a **Web3-native Agri-decision network**, free from Big Tech dependency- Scales sustainably across low-resource regions### **Why ICP?**ICP is the only blockchain that enables us to run the full backend - data storage, logic, and identity on-chain, making it:- **Cheaper** than AWS or Firebase- **Faster** and scalable- **Serverless**, secure, and decentralized- Built-in **identity system (Internet Identity)** for secure farmer access- Ideal for building trust-based tools in sensitive sectors like agriculture### **Final Vision**Imagine a future where even a 1-acre farmer, with just a basic device, can get smart, AI-informed, crop-specific advice, without ever touching an app store or paying a cloud fee. SmartSeason is not just a product; it's a movement toward **data equity and climate resilience**, powered by open tech.",

This often leads to significant yield loss, directly impacting their livelihood and food security. Additionally, the lack of real-time, localized support systems\u2014especially those in regional languages\u2014prevents timely intervention and disease management. Farmers are also heavily dependent on middlemen to sell their produce, which drastically reduces their profit margins. Even though digital marketplaces exist, they are largely inaccessible to rural farmers due to technological, educational, and linguistic barriers.

    "Team description": "**Summary**We have developed a fully functional decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to securely upload, store, and verify documents on IPFS with their hashes immutably recorded on Ethereum via our `Verfication.sol` smart contract. Our solution demonstrates end-to-end integration of Web3 components\u2014smart contracts, IPFS storage, and a responsive front\u2011end\u2014ensuring tamper\u2011proof document authentication.**Overview**This project implements a blockchain-based document verification system using IPFS for decentralized storage and Ethereum for immutable proof. Users can upload documents, store their IPFS hash on-chain via a smart contract (`Verfication.sol`), and later verify authenticity by comparing document hashes.## Smart Contract (`Verfication.sol`)- Written in Solidity; manages records mapping IPFS hashes to document owners.- Key functions:    - `uploadDocument(string memory ipfsHash)`: stores a new document hash on-chain.    - `verifyDocument(string memory ipfsHash)`: checks existence and returns a boolean.- **Security notes**: No access control\u2014anyone can call `uploadDocument`. Consider adding owner or role-based restrictions.- Front-End Analysis- **HTML Pages**:    - `login.html`: Authenticates admin via MetaMask.    - `upload.html`: Interface for uploading and hashing documents.    - `verify.html`: Allows users to input IPFS hash/scan QR to verify.    - `admin.html`, `delete.html`, `about.html`: Admin management and info pages.- **JavaScript**:    - `App.js`: Contains IPFS config (Infura keys) and smart contract ABI/address. *Keys exposed in code\u2014move to environment variables.*    - `Encryption.js`: Hashing logic before upload.    - `script.js`: UI interactions, MetaMask integration, IPFS upload via `ipfs-http-client`.- **CSS & Assets**: Clean layout using Bootstrap; ensure responsive design and accessibility.## Security & Best Practices1. **API Keys Exposure**: Infura Project ID & Secret are hardcoded in `App.js`. Use a secure backend or environment variables.2. **Access Control**: Smart contract lacks restrictions. Implement `onlyOwner` modifiers (e.g., via OpenZeppelin) to restrict sensitive functions.3. **Input Validation**: Validate document types, sizes, and sanitize user inputs on both front-end and any backend.4. **HTTPS & CORS**: Serve the application over HTTPS and configure CORS for IPFS and Ethereum nodes.5. **Dependency Management**: Remove unused dependencies and avoid committing `node_modules`.## ##",

By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with `healthlinkchain`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```bashcd healthlinkchain/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```bash# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```bashnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor# HealthLink",

It enables users to write or speak their thoughts in a secure space where AI understands emotional tone and helps guide reflection, all without logging personal identity or behavior.---## \ud83c\udfaf Problem StatementMillions of students, remote workers, and freelancers silently suffer from emotional stress and burnout. Despite the rise of mental wellness tools, many still avoid using them due to:- **Fear of surveillance** or data breaches- **Limited access to affordable therapy**- **Stigma associated with mental health**- **Overwhelming or unrelatable UIs**There is a clear need for a **non-invasive, affordable, and intelligent mental wellness tool** \u2014 one that understands without tracking, and supports without judgment.---## \u2705 SolutionThynkora AI creates a **safe digital space** where users can express themselves through journaling or chat-like conversations with an emotionally aware AI. Instead of storing logs or profiles, it uses **Internet Identity (II)** and **on-chain canisters** to ensure **true anonymity**. Over time, the AI provides feedback, mood insights, and reflection prompts \u2014 not as a therapist, but as a **supportive AI companion**.---## \ud83d\udd12 Key Features### \ud83e\udd16 AI-Powered Journaling & ChatUsers can type freely into a journal or engage with a natural language AI agent. The AI responds empathetically, mirroring thoughts and providing emotional support while detecting sentiment in real-time.### \ud83d\udcca Mood Detection & Emotional Trend TrackingThrough natural language processing (NLP), the system detects emotional tones and visualizes patterns over time. Users can track their emotional health through daily entries \u2014 no mood buttons or forced forms.### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Privacy by DesignAll journal entries are stored in **ICP canisters**, meaning no centralized database, no off-chain backups, and no surveillance. Users interact anonymously via **Internet Identity**, ensuring **no metadata or login traces** are linked to personal information.### \u2699\ufe0f DAO-Ready ArchitectureFuture iterations will allow the community to govern and evolve the platform. Users and contributors can propose new features or integrations via a decentralized governance system.---## \ud83e\udde0 How It Works (Architecture Breakdown)LayerTechnologyDescription**Frontend**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindClean, minimalist interface for writing and interaction**Backend**Internet Computer Canisters (Motoko)Stores journal entries, manages session logic, and handles AI responses**Authentication**Internet Identity (II)Ensures secure, anonymous, non-traceable login**AI Integration**LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, open-source)Processes entries, detects emotional tone, and generates AI reflections**Data Storage**ICP CanistersFully decentralized and encrypted journal data storage---## \ud83d\udc64 Target Users- **Students** facing academic pressure and emotional overload- **Remote workers & freelancers** managing stress in isolation- **Young professionals** balancing career expectations with mental health- **Users in underserved regions** where therapy is expensive or unavailable- **Anyone** seeking a private space for reflection, emotional growth, and self-awareness---## \ud83d\udcc8 Benefits to Users- **Anonymous**: No signup, no email, no tracking- **Personalized**: AI learns to respond empathetically based on emotional tone- **Decentralized**: Your data lives on-chain \u2014 not in a company\u2019s database- **Insightful**: Visual patterns help users recognize and reflect on emotional changes- **Accessible**: Minimal design, works on browser and future mobile versions---## \ud83d\udd2e Future RoadmapPhaseFeatures**Alpha Testing**Invite-only trial with feedback collection**Mobile App**Cross-platform mobile app with offline-first journaling**Mood Dashboard**Visual timeline and emotional heatmaps**Voice Input**Enable voice journaling with speech-to-text + tone detection**DAO Governance**Enable proposal/voting system for community feature suggestions**API Layer**Offer journaling engine as an embeddable tool for third-party apps/platforms---## \ud83d\ude80 Why Build on Internet Computer?- **On-chain frontend**: Entire UI is hosted in canisters \u2014 no external hosting- **Low-cost scalability**: Internet Computer provides a cost-efficient runtime- **True decentralization**: Not just \u201cblockchain backend,\u201d but full-stack decentralized- **Internet Identity**: Secure and anonymous logins without user data collection",

Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with `green_gauge`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```bashcd green_gauge/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```bash# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```bashnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor",

Language barriers and lack of awareness only make things worse. **In this digital era, healthcare shouldn\u2019t be a distant dream.**2. **Existing Solutions:******     There are teleconsultation apps, health monitoring devices, and chatbot-based assistants. But they demand **stable internet, smartphones, and digital literacy,** things that many rural citizens still lack. Even then, there\u2019s no emotional connection, no human presence. The experience is often robotic, unreliable, or difficult to access. **Healthcare needs to feel human. Not just available but approachable.**3. **Our Hero: HoloHealth Enters******     Meet **HoloHealth** - an **AI-powered holographic doctor** designed to **bring real, lifelike medical support into remote and underserved communities**. Imagine walking into a village center and seeing a warm, 3D hologram of a doctor that **greets you, listens to you, speaks your local language, and guides you just like a real person would**.HoloHealth **isn\u2019t just a display,** it\u2019s an experience. It combines empathy, intelligence, and presence in one powerful tool that makes healthcare feel personal again. Even without a strong internet connection.4. **Key Features & Practical Impact:******     Here's how HoloHealth is a game-changer:- **3D Holographic Interaction** \u2013 Patients interact naturally with a full-sized holographic doctor.-  **Multilingual Support** \u2013 Speaks local languages and dialects to break language barriers.-  **Health Checkups & Diagnosis** \u2013 AI models give instant suggestions and health triaging.-  **Connect to Real Doctors** \u2013 Seamlessly escalates to real-time video consultations if needed.-  **Offline Mode** \u2013 Works in areas with poor or no internet. Data syncs later.-  **Emotion-Aware AI** \u2013 Detects emotions like fear or distress and responds gently.-  **Medical History & Reports** \u2013 Stores patient history securely and shares with real doctors.-  **Portable Setup** \u2013 Can be installed in schools, buses, anganwadis, panchayat offices, or even homes.**Impact**: *\"A mother doesn\u2019t need to travel 15 km for her child\u2019s fever. An elderly      diabetic gets timely advice. And an entire village feels the presence of a doctor who never sleeps.\"*5. **Tech Stack Behind the Magic**:We didn\u2019t just build an idea\u2014we built a **blended tech solution** with real-world practicality:-  **AI/ML (Python, TensorFlow)** \u2013 For disease detection, emotion sensing, and smart diagnosis.-  **3D Holography (Blender, Looking Glass, Unity)** \u2013 Creates life-like, human-level interaction.-  **Web App (React + Tailwind CSS)** \u2013 For admin control, analytics, and medical record management.-  **Firebase / Supabase** \u2013 Secure real-time database for patient data, syncs offline/online.-  **WebRTC / Agora SDK** \u2013 Enables live video consultations with real doctors.-  **Blockchain / IPFS (Optional)** \u2013 For tamper-proof medical records (future phase).-  **Raspberry Pi / Edge Devices** \u2013 To run the system cost-efficiently in rural setups.**Final Words:****HoloHealth isn\u2019t just a project. It\u2019s a promise.** A promise that no one, no matter where they live should be left behind when it comes to healthcare. With empathy, tech, and design, we\u2019re bringing the doctor closer to every doorstep.",

    "Team description": "The World Computer Lottery represents a three-pronged approach to advancing awareness and engagement on the Internet Computer, seeking to improve the experience of,1. everyday users,2. governance participants, and3. developers.------1. Everyday Users - *Build it and they will come*- Most everyday people are still unfamiliar with Web3 technologies, as the benefits and use cases can sometimes be difficult to grasp. However, most people are familiar with the concept of a lottery, and many regularly take part in national lotteries. The benefits of a decentralised, trustless, fully-verifiable lottery, should be clear to the vast majority of people. While national lotteries often take a huge portion of the ticket revenue and/or redistribute it to charities and other organisations, the World Computer Lottery puts the player in charge. 100% of the ticket cost is allocated to the Jackpot if the player chooses to opt out of a small 1% donation for improving governance and security on the Internet Computer (which is staked into an NNS-controlled neuron).2. Governance Participants - *Secure it and they will stake*- Most users on the Internet Computer do not have much time to engaged in governance and NNS proposal reviews. Yet these are what secure the network and protect everyone's stake. Initiatives such as [D-QUORUM](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/4713806069430754115) and [ALPHA-Vote](https://github.com/aodl/ALPHA-Vote) are intended to reduce friction around governance, and make it easier for the community to make the most of the NNS while ensuring the NNS gets the best of the community. An optional donation to the D-QUORUM stake will be built into the World Computer Lottery (capped at no more than 1% of the cost of tickets). This ensures the safety of the jackpot hosted by the network, and also ensures the integrity and sanctity of the smart contracts running on the Internet Computer (including the lottery itself). 3. Developers - *Fuel it and make it unstoppable*- If a World Computer Lottery is to have large funds flowing through it, it needs to be easy to trust, either by blackholing the smart contract or assigning sole control to the NNS. However a smart contract cannot be considered unstoppable and independent if it can run out of cycles/gas. The World Computer Lottery therefore needs a perpetual supply of cycles that is not dependent on any individual (both in terms of the source of funds, and the action of topping up the canister). A sister project is underway to facilitate this feature (a link to that repo will be made available soon). This feature will be re-usable and easily applicable to any and all canisters a developer may wish to establish perpetual cycles for, thereby improving the developer experience and making it easier to build unstoppable dapps that showcase IC capabilities (one of which is the World Computer Lottery).[aodl/WorldComputerLotteryFrontend: A frontend to the World Computer Lottery](https://github.com/aodl/WorldComputerLotteryFrontend)",

This creates challenges around trust, misinformation, ownership, and misuse of AI outputs.**DeTrustAI** solves this by using blockchain to verify, timestamp, and prove the originality of AI-generated content. It creates a tamper-proof digital certificate for any AI output, allowing anyone to verify its authenticity in a decentralized and trustless way.---### Category**Crypto / Web3**---### Is this BUIDL an AI Agent?**No**---### Summary of the Project**DeTrustAI** is a blockchain-based platform that enables users to upload AI-generated content (such as text, images, or code). The platform generates a unique digital fingerprint (hash) of the content using SHA-256 and stores this hash along with a timestamp on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or Polygon). This allows anyone to verify the originality and integrity of the content by comparing its hash with the stored value, ensuring it hasn\u2019t been tampered with or plagiarized.Optionally, the actual content can be stored on decentralized storage (IPFS), while only the hash and metadata are stored on-chain. The system operates without any centralized authority, providing a public, transparent, and trustless proof-of-integrity tool for AI outputs.---### Key Innovation Domains (in Crypto/Web3)- **Decentralized Content Verification**: Authenticates AI-generated content by hashing and storing its fingerprint on-chain.- **Proof-of-Integrity**: Enables tamper detection using hash comparison.- **Blockchain Timestamping**: Proves when content was created using smart contracts.- **AI\u2013Blockchain Bridge**: Integrates blockchain with AI tools to track content origin.- **Optional IPFS Storage**: Stores actual content off-chain using IPFS for scalability.- **Public Transparency**: Allows anyone to verify content authenticity without login or trust assumptions.---### Tech Stack (for prototype or mockup)- **Frontend**: HTML + JavaScript (or React for UI)- **Hashing**: SHA-256 (using Crypto API)- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or Polygon testnet (using Solidity smart contracts)- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (optional)- **Storage**: IPFS (optional for storing actual files)---### Real-world Applications- **Students** verifying their AI-generated essays.- **Artists** proving ownership of AI art.- **Developers** certifying AI-assisted code.- **Job applicants or freelancers** proving originality in resumes or portfolios.",

What truly distinguishes Poro is its core emphasis on user privacy through end to end encryption and fully on-chain models, all while making AI accessible to unbanked populations in emerging markets via effortless, borderless stablecoin payments\u2014no credit cards needed.Leading AI models are locked behind steep paywalls, targeting users with access to traditional payment systems in developed markets and operating centrally, thus restricting access for the 1.3 billion unbanked people worldwide. However, Poro shatters these barriers with micro-payments via ckUSDC stablecoins, granting borderless AI access to the 1.3 billion unbanked adults worldwide\u2014predominantly in emerging economies\u2014without reliance on credit cards or traditional banks.While leading AI models serves as a consumer-facing tool with a seamless interface for querying AI models to generate answers, summaries, or insights without technical expertise, it lacks developer infrastructure for building or customizing applications, limiting its scope to end-users. In contrast, Poro\u2019s ICP-native architecture, built on the Internet Computer Protocol blockchain, empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) and integrate AI into Web3 ecosystems like DeFi and DAOs, leveraging ICP\u2019s web-scale smart contract capabilities for on-chain AI execution to automate tasks such as yield farming, predictive analytics, voting mechanisms, or resource allocation. Poro\u2019s smart agents\u2014autonomous blockchain programs\u2014enable features like transparent, secure micropayments via ckUSDC stablecoins, fostering efficiency in trustless environments and unlocking innovative applications like self-governing financial protocols and collaborative AI networks, thus democratizing AI within a dynamic, interconnected Web3 economy.Centralized AI models often overlook user privacy and data sovereignty, potentially harvesting query data for personalization or third-party use. Poro\u2019s decentralized on-chain execution and zero-knowledge proofs deliver a privacy-first solution, ensuring secure, user-controlled data processing. While centralized AI models frequently compromise user privacy and data sovereignty by collecting and potentially sharing query data for personalization or third-party purposes, Poro\u2019s innovative approach leverages decentralized on-chain execution and zero-knowledge proofs to provide a robust, privacy-first alternative that ensures secure, transparent, and user-controlled data processing on the IC.",

    "Team description": "Game ini lahir dari sebuah perjalanan\u2014dari keinginan sederhana untuk memahami dan mempraktikkan konsep **Pemrograman Berorientasi Objek (OOP)** hingga ambisi untuk menciptakan sebuah pengalaman yang utuh dan menantang.Tujuan utama di balik pengembangan game ini adalah:1. **Sebagai Proyek Pembelajaran:** Mengubah teori OOP\u2014seperti `class`, `object`, dan `inheritance`\u2014menjadi sebuah aplikasi nyata yang interaktif. Game ini adalah bukti nyata bagaimana konsep-konsep tersebut dapat digunakan untuk membangun sistem yang kompleks dan dinamis dari nol.2. **Menggabungkan Genre Favorit:** Terinspirasi dari game TCG dan RPG klasik, tujuannya adalah untuk menciptakan sebuah hibrida unik yang menggabungkan **strategi mendalam** dari permainan kartu dengan **progresi karakter** dan pertarungan epik dari RPG.3. **Menciptakan Pengalaman Taktis:** Memberikan tantangan kepada pemain di mana setiap pilihan kartu di awal dan setiap aksi di dalam pertarungan memiliki dampak yang signifikan. Kemenangan tidak hanya ditentukan oleh keberuntungan, tetapi oleh kemampuan pemain dalam menyusun strategi, mengelola sumber daya (HP dan Energi kartu), dan beradaptasi dengan tantangan yang terus meningkat.4. **Menjadi Portofolio:** Pada akhirnya, game ini dirancang untuk menjadi sebuah portofolio yang menunjukkan kemampuan dalam merancang logika game, menstrukturkan kode, dan mengembangkan sebuah proyek dari ide menjadi produk yang dapat dimainkan.",

Effortless.**`ghostkeys.app` is a zero-friction vault for developers and everyday users to manage secrets with security and simplicity, leveraging decentralization to reduce costs, enhance privacy, and increase reliability.Built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), GhostKeys offers an ultra-lightweight experience with no logins, no server dependencies, and full client-side encryption. Our goal: replace painful Web2 infra with trustless, usable Web3 primitives.---## \ud83d\ude80 VisionWe\u2019re building the **invisible glue for modern Web3 and Web2 hybrid infrastructure** \u2014 replacing traditional infra components like:- \ud83d\udd11 Secrets Managers (GCP, AWS, Bitwarden)- \ud83d\udd10 Corporate Password Vaults (LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password)- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Gateway Auth (API Keys, Rotations, SSO, etc.)- \u2699\ufe0f Config-as-a-Service (Environment & access config with zero DevOps friction)All powered by client-side cryptography, decentralized storage, and the **unique HTTP request capabilities** of the Internet Computer.### \ud83e\udd16 AI-Agent Friendly by DesignGhostKeys is built to **safely interface with autonomous agents** \u2014 whether LLMs, bots, or local copilots \u2014 without compromising data security.We recognize that AI agents can be powerful tools for automation, but also introduce **unintentional data exposure risks** when interacting with unstructured or plaintext databases. To address this, GhostKeys makes the following guarantees:- \ud83d\udd10 **Always Encrypted**: Any data input or modified by AI agents is encrypted on the client before leaving the environment \u2014 no plaintext is ever stored or transmitted.- \ud83e\udde0 **Agent-Usable Vaults**: Agents can read and write to vaults without requiring access to underlying encryption keys \u2014 they operate through secure local APIs.- \ud83e\uddfe **Structured Secrets Templates**: Designed to guide agents toward predictable formats (e.g., API keys, tokens, configs) to reduce hallucination and data loss.- \ud83e\udde9 **Composable Access**: Agents can embed GhostKeys as a secure memory module within broader workflows without altering core vault logic.GhostKeys serves as the **\"secure memory layer\"** for local or cloud-based agents. Whether auto-filling credentials, rotating secrets, or storing environment configs \u2014 your vault remains agent-accessible but never agent-compromised.---## \u2728 Key Features- \ud83d\udd10 **Client-Side Encryption**: All secrets encrypted before leaving your device- \ud83e\udde0 **Mnemonic-Free Identity**: Auth via wallet signature or ephemeral key- \ud83d\udcc1 **Vault Templates**: Create structured secrets for apps, APIs, infra configs- \u26d3\ufe0f **Offline-First**: Operates fully offline with optional sync- \ud83e\udde9 **Composable**: Drop-in iFrame or SDK for developers to embed secrets- \ud83c\udf10 **Decentralized Storage**: Internet Computer provides zero-cost hosting- \ud83d\udc65 **Multi-profile Support**: Manage multiple vaults or org contexts- \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f **Instant UX**: No login, no setup, just land and start typing---## \ud83d\udce6 Architecture![GhostKeysArch.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/1983e89fab89bfed232ac134bfc9389d.png)---## \ud83d\udee4\ufe0f Roadmap### \u2705 Phase 1: MVP (Complete or Nearing Complete)- [x] Local-first vault with table UI (structured entry grid)- [x] Create/edit/delete vaults and rows- [x] Add/remove columns, with secret/plain toggle- [x] Removed Phantom wallet auth from prev version- [x] Deployable on local DFX### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Phase 2: Zero-Friction UX & Personal Canister Sync- [ ] Add optional Internet Identy identity- [ ] Derive per-user keys from signatures (not seed phrases)- [ ] Stable memory for vault state (canister-per-user model)- [ ] Instant auto-save to IndexedDB- [ ] Optional: sync button for canister upload/download### \ud83d\udce6 Phase 3: Developer Templates & SDK- [ ] Template gallery: SSH config, API keys, JWT sets, etc.- [ ] Embed GhostKeys into other apps via iFrame or SDK- [ ] CLI tool for CI/CD secrets usage- [ ] Vault export/import with optional encryption key- [ ] Full AI agent integration### \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Phase 4: Corporate & Team Vaults- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)- [ ] Vault sharing and team invites- [ ] Audit logs (locally stored)- [ ] Template for rotating credentials### \ud83e\udde0 Phase 5: Smart Agents & AI Ops- [ ] Local LLM for vault analysis (\u201cyou\u2019re missing an SSH key for server X\u201d)- [ ] Agent-assisted secret population from dev environments---",

Our project enables users to unlock the value of their Bitcoin Ordinals without selling them, creating a new paradigm for Bitcoin-based decentralized finance.### Problem StatementBitcoin Ordinals represent valuable digital assets,\u00a0but they suffer from a fundamental liquidity crisis. Users face a binary choice: either hold their Ordinals indefinitely or\u00a0sell them completely. This creates a\u00a0significant barrier to capital efficiency and prevents Ordinals from being used\u00a0as productive assets in the broader\u00a0DeFi ecosystem.### Solution OverviewBitLock\u00a0introduces the world's first Bitcoin Ordinals lending protocol built on the Internet Computer. Our platform\u00a0uses threshold ECDSA cryptography to create secure custody addresses for Ordinals,\u00a0enabling\u00a0users to:1. Lock Ordinals\u00a0in Secure Custody: Using ICP's\u00a0threshold ECDSA\u00a0for multi-party\u00a0key management2. Mint Receipt NFTs: Create liquid representations\u00a0of locked Ordinals3. Borrow Against NFTs: Access\u00a0liquidity using\u00a0NFTs\u00a0as collateral4. Unlock\u00a0Original Ordinals: Repay loans and reclaim\u00a0original assets### Technical ArchitectureOur solution combines three cutting-edge\u00a0technologies:- Bitcoin\u00a0Integration: Real Bitcoin\u00a0UTXO management with\u00a0actual transactions (no mocks)- Internet Computer Canisters: Rust-based\u00a0smart contracts\u00a0for lending\u00a0protocol logic- Threshold ECDSA: 3-of-5 key sharing for secure custody address generationThe architecture features a React frontend,\u00a0Node.js\u00a0backend API, and\u00a0ICP canister\u00a0backend,\u00a0all working\u00a0together to provide a seamless user experience.### Technical ImplementationThe platform\u00a0consists of several\u00a0key\u00a0components:Frontend: Modern React application with real-time balance tracking and transaction\u00a0monitoringBackend API: Node.js server that\u00a0proxies Bitcoin\u00a0CLI\u00a0commands and ICP\u00a0canister callsICP Canister: Rust smart contract handling\u00a0custody records, NFT\u00a0minting, and lending logicBitcoin Integration: Direct UTXO management\u00a0through\u00a0Bitcoin Core regtest### Impact\u00a0and Future PotentialBitLock addresses a fundamental gap\u00a0in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. By enabling liquidity\u00a0for Ordinals without requiring\u00a0users\u00a0to sell their assets, we unlock new\u00a0possibilities for:- Capital efficiency in\u00a0the Ordinals market- New DeFi primitives for Bitcoin- Institutional\u00a0adoption of Ordinals as collateral- Cross-chain\u00a0bridges and advanced financial productsThis\u00a0project demonstrates the power of\u00a0combining Bitcoin's security with the Internet\u00a0Computer's programmability, creating innovative\u00a0solutions\u00a0that were previously impossible.### Development\u00a0StatusThe project is fully functional\u00a0with a complete end-to-end implementation.

It allows burning of approved network (RegNet) tokens to mine a scarce, limited-supply asset (AK69).It aims to create perpetual demand and deflationary pressure for RegNet tokens and game theoretically align economic incentives for rational network participation.This mechanism helps bootstrap projects in an ecosystem by fusing diverse token economies with aligned value systems into a powerful, unified force.### Problem[Regnerative Finance (ReFi) ecosystem](https://carboncopy.news/learn/regenerative-finance-refi-explained/) is building socio-economic systems that align human prosperity to nature\u2019s thriving. It aims to evolve capitalism into a new form that accounts for all externalities that are conveniently ignored in the neoliberal economic theory. ReFi incentivises positive outcomes for society by redefining progress that works for all, including the planet. This takes shape in the form of:- Digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV) of impact credits- Circular economy projects - supply chain traceability- Impact credit marketplaces- Climate data oracles and risk analysis- Climate project finance, collaborative finance- Public goods funding mechanisms (quadratic, retroactive, et al)- Community currencies- X to Earn rewarding protocolsReFi currently struggles with attention and capital inflow to build the infrastructure needed to scale the ecosystem. The projects in the ecosystem pursue specialised goals, solving unique projblems across the spectrum while collectively moving towards a common vision.These projects and ecosytem in general requires a catalyst to create market demand and deflationary pressure for established token projects within the ecosytem. Anti Klimactic aims to be the spark that ingites the movement and brings it the attention capital it deserves in a fun, game-like mechasim where all stakeholders win.### SolutionAnti Klimactic proposes a proof of burn consensus mechanism to bootstrap the ReFi ecosystem by allowing permanent commitment of economic value to mine a scarce, limited supply asset.Proof of Burn mimics Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work mechanism without needing to spend incredible amounts of energy to produce new blocks and secure the network. It\u2019s inspired by BOB on ICP as well as Bittensor and Bitcoin, adopting the best parts to resuscitate the ReFi ecosystem.It leverages Chain Fusion to interact with established ReFi token projects and allows participation of those communities with a seamless, familiar user experience such as on EVM chains.Additionally, building it as a game like interface coupled with meme fuelled storytelling adds freshness and excitement to the space, never seen before. ### How it Works- Users in possession of approved RegNet tokens burn them to receive FUEL.- New users have to obtain RegNet tokens from a DEX or CEX before burning.- After burning, they spin up a miner, set FUEL spending rate and compete to mine AK69.- FUEL spent adds weight to the probability and a verifiable randomness function is used to select block winner.### Governance- Majority vote to add or remove RegNet tokens from burn mechanism.- Voting rights on future protocol and network related upgrades.",

Smart Irrigation \u2013 Uses Arduino and soil moisture sensors to water crops automatically and save water.2. Rain Alerts \u2013 A weather forecast system warns farmers before it rains so they can protect crops.3. Offline Dashboard App \u2013 An Android app that works without the internet and uses local languages and voice instructions.4. AI-Powered Waste Reuse \u2013 If crops spoil, the app suggests how to turn waste into compost, biogas, animal feed, or mushrooms \u2013 turning loss into income.5. Transport Optimization \u2013 Helps farmers book and plan routes to sell their produce faster.6. Community-Based Model \u2013 Encourages farmer groups to work together and build local reuse centers.---\ud83d\ude80 How does it work?1. Install the sensors and app in demo farms.2. Link weather data for alerts.3. Teach farmers using visual and voice content.4. Collect feedback and improve.5. Scale it to more villages.---\ud83d\udce6 What are the key benefits?Saves water (up to 30%)Reduces crop spoilageCreates extra income from wasteWorks offline \u2013 no need for strong internetEasy to use \u2013 even for farmers with no tech backgroundBuilds community sustainability---\ud83d\udd2d Future GoalsReach 50+ villagesAdd crop health monitoring via satellitesUse voice-based chatbots for farmer supportHelp farmers earn carbon credits through compostingBuild a marketplace to sell reused products like mushrooms",

It is born from the conviction that the future of online community should not be in the hands of centralized corporations, but in the hands of the users themselves. The project's vision is to create a ecosystem of interconnected, self-governed communities, free from the data harvesting, opaque algorithms, and centralized control points that define the current social media landscape.### **Core Philosophy***   **Absolute Decentralization:** Every piece of data is stored on-chain within canisters. The entire application runs on the Internet Computer's public network, eliminating reliance on private servers.*   **User Sovereignty & Ownership:** Users are identified by their self-custodied Internet Identity `Principal`. Content created by a user belongs to them; content created within a community belongs to that community.*   **Community-Led Governance:** SectorNet is designed to become a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Its evolution, rules, and moderation are ultimately controlled by the community through on-chain voting and transparent proposals.*   **Privacy by Design:** The architecture prioritizes user privacy. Private communications can be end-to-end encrypted, and the platform minimizes the collection of user data to the absolute essentials.## **Key Features***   **100% On-Chain:** The entire platform is hosted on the Internet Computer. And when E2E becomes unfeasible for large communities, a planned self-hosted canister is planned!*   **Canister-Based Architecture:** The platform uses a Service-Oriented Architecture, where each community (**Sector**) is its own independent canister, ensuring scalability and resilience.*   **Internet Identity:** Secure, passwordless authentication using the IC's native WebAuthn-based identity solution.*   **Public & Private Sectors:** Users can create and join discoverable public communities or invite-only private groups.*   **Dual-Tier Chat Security:**    *   **High-Security E2EE Mode:** For small, private Sectors (<=50 members), offering verifiable end-to-end encryption with moderator-led key rotation.    *   **Standard Access-Control Mode:** A scalable and performant model for large public communities.*   **Global & Sector Feeds:** A curated public Global Feed aggregates high-quality posts, while each Sector maintains its own private, encrypted feed.*   **The UI:** A unique design philosophy blending glass morphism with a terminal-inspired aesthetic for a focused, information-dense user experience.*   **Role-Based Permissions:** A powerful `[User Tag | Sector Role]` system separates global platform status from local community roles.",

    "Team description": "# The DevOps & Orchestration Platform for the Internet Computer## MotivationWe are building complex application that uses nearly all IC specific features combining onchain and offchain functionality. And far before release on the step of architecturing the app we want to solve future scaling bottlenecks.According to [story of IC app with a lot of users described here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/lament-a-tale-of-constant-struggle-of-what-its-like-trying-to-scale-on-icp/35829), we see that it is not so easy to scale on IC, but certainly possible. And it could be thorny path to evolve from single-canister architecture to multi-canister and multi-subnet systems. And a lot of mistakes could be done on this path.Also it is crucial to have clean and easy development flow, when developer can develop and test multi-subnet system locally, push it to development branch and test it with other team developer's modules in the cloud, and then push to test branch where system will be automatically deployed and ready for testing (all without submitting to mainnet). After tests are complete, release could be created and github workflow will push it to mainnet where it should be approven by DAO to make updates decentralized.All of it certainly could be done, but there is no any step by step best practice guide to acheave it.**So we start thinking on infrastructure project** that would help to acheave our internal goals and could help other teams to build more complex apps on IC easier.## Overview**ICR (Internet Computer Registry)** is an infrastructure platform for orchestrating and managing the application lifecycle, acting as something like a Kubernetes for multi-canister environments on IC. The project aims to radically simplify and automate the CI/CD processes, deployments for tests, log-tracing, versioning, shipping to mainnet and scaling processes for complex multicanister IC applications. It also provides a unified test environment for onchain (possible multisubnet) and offchain components that use http-outcall functionality.It can and will provide an easy way for developers to build and test scalable complex IC solutions with combination with offchain functionality.## How It Works (should work)### Development Workflow1. **Mono-repository Structure**: Developers create a mono-repository that contains canister modules and backend offchain modules2. **Declarative Configuration**: Using declarations, these modules are combined into an application that can be built and deployed to cloud-based development environments3. **Cloud Infrastructure**: GitHub workflows help create Kubernetes clusters in the cloud (AWS, GCS, etc.) where Pocket IC, offchain modules, and logging/monitoring tooling are installed4. **Orchestration Core**: At Pocket IC, orchestration core canisters are automatically installed### Deployment Process- **CLI Tools**: Built application modules and canister WASMs are uploaded to the orchestration core- **Registry Management**: Canisters are added to the registry with branch and tag metadata and created in Pocket IC- **Service Discovery**: Orchestration helps discover application canisters and offchain modules as services, enabling multiple non-conflicting versions of the same application in a cluster for testing and development purposes- **Mainnet Deployment**: After testing, applications can be released to mainnet with project GitHub workflows- **Auto-scaling**: Orchestration helps autoscale canisters (replicate and shard) across subnets## Project Goals### Primary Objectives- **Simplified Development**: Provide developers with intuitive tools to build and deploy complex multi-canister applications- **Automated CI/CD**: Streamline the entire development lifecycle from local development to mainnet deployment- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure identical development, testing, and production environments- **Version Control**: Implement Git-like versioning for WASM modules with full metadata tracking### Scaling & Performance Goals- **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatically replicate or shard canisters across multiple subnets to handle increased load- **Intelligent Sharding**: Distribute canister instances across subnets based on load patterns and resource requirements- **Load Balancing**: Implement smart routing to distribute requests across canister replicas- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize cross-subnet communication overhead through strategic canister placement- **Resource Management**: Optimize canister placement to balance resource utilization across subnets### Security & Governance- **DAO Integration**: Implement decentralized governance for deployment approvals and updates- **Access Control**: Provide fine-grained permissions for different deployment stages- **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all deployment and scaling activities- **Integrity Verification**: Ensure deployed code matches built binaries through SHA-256 verification### Monitoring & Observability- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track canister health, performance, and resource utilization- **Distributed Tracing**: Monitor cross-canister and offchain communication- **Alerting System**: Proactive notifications for performance issues and failures- **Dashboard Visualization**: Web-based interface for system state and metrics## Core Architecture & ComponentsOur architecture is divided into logical components that work together to create a robust and flexible environment for developers.### ICR Core Service (Control Plane)The core of the system wraps Pocket IC for local and cloud testing and provides a REST API for managing WASM modules (upload, list, version).### ICR CLI (Command-Line Interface)A client tool, that interacts with the Core Service. It uses dfx to build canisters, calculate their SHA-256 checksums, and automate deployments to target PocketIC (install, upgrade, reinstall).### Registry-Factory Canister (The Orchestration Core)A key smart canister that manages all other canisters in the environment. It provides:- **Service Discovery**: Canisters communicate via service names rather than canisterIds, providing location transparency- **Auto-scaling**: Manages canister sharding and replication across subnets to distribute load- **Load Distribution**: Intelligently routes requests to optimal canister instances- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks canister health and resource utilization### DAO ModuleA canister based on SNS, that is responsible for approving deployment and updating of orchestrated canisters and their parameters.### CI/CD Scheme![Development infrastructure small.jpg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/1984056fac5867170a899c846dca2c2e.jpg)## Key Features & WorkflowICR provides developers with tools that make working with multi-canister systems predictable and efficient.### Git-like WASM VersioningFull metadata tracking for every WASM module (branch, tag, commit hash) for transparent auditing and version control and integrating into CI/CD workflows.### Integrity and SecurityAutomatic calculation and verification of SHA-256 hashes for each binary, ensuring the deployed code is exactly what was built.### Environment ParityThe core.json and environment.json concept, combined with Pocket IC, allows preparation of development and testing environments. Autotesting tooling can be run against such environments (canister combinations and states). It also allows for creating identical dev and production environments, eliminating discrepancies.### Advanced AutomationThe CLI supports complex deployment scenarios, including fresh installs, upgrades, and reinstalls via a single command.## Hackathon Goals \ud83d\ude80### Enhanced Orchestration LogicEnhancing the registry-factory to introduce:- Location transparency- Logging and monitoring### DAO Integration- Implement SNS-based governance for deployment approvals- Create voting mechanisms for system upgrades### Monitoring Web UICreating a basic dashboard to visualize:- State of deployed canisters- Their interconnections- Current status and log tracing### Example ApplicationWe will provide an example and describe the development and configuration of an application that has:- Multiple canisters communicating via service discovery- Offchain module integration via http-outcalls (also connected via service discovery)- Complete build and deployment workflow using GitHub workflows- Multi-version deployment for different test environments- Mainnet deployment with DAO-governed updates- As a bonus github workflows to create dev/test clusters in Google cloud or AWS",

Dependency Management is Critical**What We Learned**: Exact dependency versions matter significantly in ICP development.```# Working Configuration (Cargo.toml)[dependencies]ic-cdk = \"0.14\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 # NOT 0.15 (has breaking changes)ic-cdk-timers = \"0.11\" \u00a0 \u00a0# NOT 0.10 (missing features)ic-stable-structures = \"0.6.4\" \u00a0# Specific patch version neededic-alloy = { version = \"0.4\", features = [\"reqwest\", \"rpc-types\"] }```javascript**Lesson**: Always start with the official ICP starter dependency versions rather than latest.### 2. EVM RPC Canister Initialization**Problem**: Initial deployment failed with complex initialization arguments.**Solution**: Use simple initialization:```# CORRECT - Worksdfx canister call evm_rpc init '(record {})'# WRONG - Failsdfx canister call evm_rpc init '(record { logFilter = opt variant { HideAll }})'```javascript**Lesson**: Start simple with EVM RPC canister, add complexity later.### 3. Thread-Local State Management**Critical Pattern**:```use std::cell::RefCell;thread_local! {static STATE: RefCell<Option<State>> = RefCell::new(None);}// Always use this pattern for state accessfn with_state<R>(f: impl FnOnce(&State) -> R) -> R {STATE.with(|s| f(s.borrow().as_ref().expect(\"State not initialized\")))}```javascript**Lesson**: Proper state management prevents reentrancy issues and ensures data consistency.### 4. Event Processing Strategy**What Works**: Topic-based event detection```// Simple and reliable approachif log.topics.len() >= 1 {match log.topics[0] {MINT_TOPIC => process_mint_event(log),REDEEM_TOPIC => process_redeem_event(log),// ... other events}}```javascript**What Doesn't**: Complex type conversions between alloy::rpc::types::Log and alloy::primitives::Log**Lesson**: Keep event processing simple and focus on topic matching over complex deserialization.### 5. Timer Management**Successful Pattern**:```// Set up recurring timer in canister_initic_cdk_timers::set_timer_interval(Duration::from_secs(60), move || {ic_cdk::spawn(async {if let Err(e) = scrape_events_all_chains().await {ic_cdk::print(&format!(\"Timer error: {}\", e));}});});```javascript**Lesson**: Always wrap timer logic in `ic_cdk::spawn` for async operations.### 6. Build Configuration**Working dfx.json**:```{\"canisters\": {\"peridot_monitor\": {\"type\": \"rust\",\"package\": \"peridot_monitor\",\"init_arg_file\": \"./initArgument.did\"}},\"networks\": {\"local\": {\"bind\": \"127.0.0.1:4943\",\"type\": \"ephemeral\"}}}```javascript**Lesson**: Separate initialization arguments into `.did` files for complex configurations.## Architecture```\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u00a0 \u00a0\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u00a0 \u00a0\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\u2502 \u00a0 Monad Testnet \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0ICP Canister \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0BNB Testnet \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502\u2502 \u00a0 (Chain 41454) \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0(DEPLOYED) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 (Chain 97) \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502\u2502 Peridot Contract\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25b6\u2502 Event Monitor \u00a0 \u2502\u25c0\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Peridot Contract\u2502\u2502 0xa41D586... \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u2705 Active \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 0xe797A0... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502\u2502 60s Timer \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25b6\u2502 State Sync \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502\u25c0\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 60s Timer \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u2705 Working \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\u2502 Query Interface \u2502\u2502 \u2705 All endpoints\u2502\u2502 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2502\u2502 Stable Storage \u00a0\u2502\u2502 \u2705 Persistent \u00a0 \u2502\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518```javascript## Prerequisites- [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) (latest version)- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target- Access to Monad and BNB testnet RPC endpoints## Quick Start### 1.

    "Team description": "In today's fast-paced financial world, individuals often struggle to manage their assets, plan investments, and understand the complexities of cryptocurrency and digital payments. Our project aims to bridge that gap by offering a comprehensive, AI-powered financial ecosystem that brings together personalised planning, crypto trading, blockchain technology, and financial education \u2014 all in a single, seamless application.### Key Features- **Hybrid & AI-Powered Financial Planner**: Users can hire a virtual financial planner who helps analyse income, expenses, and investment goals. The system utilises a Large Language Model (LLM) that functions as a personal finance assistant, learning from user behaviour to provide increasingly accurate suggestions over time.- **Smart Chat Interface**: Like interacting with ChatGPT, users can prompt the AI to ask financial questions, request portfolio analysis, or get personalised recommendations. The system can also generate visual charts and advanced buy/sell points to guide users' trading decisions.- **Integrated Crypto Exchange & Transactions**: The platform allows users to trade cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) directly within the app. Users can execute buy/sell actions, view market trends, and automate trading strategies using insights provided by the AI.- **Premium Education Marketplace**: Users can access curated financial education content, including courses, webinars, and e-books, to improve their financial literacy and investment knowledge.- **Blockchain-Powered Payment System**: Inspired by platforms like Coinbase, Bitget, and Binance, the app includes its token for internal payments. All transactions \u2014 whether for subscriptions, education purchases, or planner services \u2014 are recorded transparently on the blockchain.- **Behavioural Learning Engine**: The LLM observes user trading behaviour, risk tolerance, and financial patterns. Over time, it becomes more adaptive, offering smarter financial paths and alerts for risky actions or missed opportunities.### VisionOur vision is to democratize access to intelligent financial planning and crypto trading tools, especially for emerging markets. By blending AI, blockchain, and education, we aim to empower individuals to grow their wealth responsibly and sustainably \u2014 no matter their financial background.",

Our mission is to restore data ownership to patients while facilitating seamless, secure data exchange in the healthcare ecosystem.## \ud83d\ude80 InspirationThe healthcare industry is plagued by fragmented data, lack of interoperability, and data breaches. Patients often have little to no control over their own health information, leading to inefficiencies and privacy concerns. We were inspired by the potential of decentralized technology to solve these problems. By building on the Internet Computer, we can create a system that is not only secure and patient-centric but also transparent and auditable.## \u2728 What it doesMediVet provides a comprehensive solution for digital health record management:- **For Patients**:    - **Own Your Data**: Create and manage a comprehensive health profile that you control.    - **Granular Sharing**: Grant specific permissions to healthcare providers (e.g., view basic info, medical history, allergies) for a limited time.    - **End-to-End Encryption**: All health records are encrypted on the client-side before being stored on-chain.    - **Full Transparency**: A complete, immutable audit trail of who has accessed your data and when.- **For Healthcare Providers**:    - **Seamless Access**: View patient records shared with you through a dedicated dashboard.    - **Secure Data Handling**: Decrypt and access patient data based on the permissions granted by the patient.    - **Trust and Verification**: Confidently access patient data, knowing it comes directly from the source.## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f How we built itMediVet is built on a modern, decentralized stack, leveraging the power of the Internet Computer.### **Backend (Motoko on ICP)**:- **Language**: Motoko- **Core Logic**: The backend canister (`main.mo`) handles user authentication, profile management, health record storage, and permission logic.- **Data Storage**: All data is stored securely within the Internet Computer's canister storage.- **Encryption**: We implement a robust encryption strategy using AES-GCM. Each health record is encrypted with a unique symmetric key, which is then encrypted with the user's public key. This ensures that only the patient can decrypt their own data.- **Authentication**: We use Internet Identity for secure, passwordless authentication, tying all actions to a user's cryptographic identity (principal).### **Frontend (React & TypeScript)**:- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for a fast, modern development experience.- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design.- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management.- **Crypto Operations**: All encryption and decryption happen client-side in the browser, ensuring that unencrypted data never leaves the user's device. We use the Web Crypto API for this.- **Real-time Updates**: The frontend uses a polling mechanism to keep data synchronized with the backend in near real-time.##  Challenges we ran into- **Client-Side Encryption Complexity**: Implementing a secure and user-friendly client-side encryption system was challenging. Managing keys, ensuring data integrity, and handling the user experience for an encrypted system required careful design and implementation.- **Granular Access Control**: Designing and implementing the granular permission system was complex. We had to ensure that the logic was watertight and that there were no loopholes that could lead to unauthorized data access.- **State Management with Polling**: Synchronizing the frontend state with the backend in a decentralized environment without a traditional pub/sub system required a carefully implemented polling service to ensure the UI was always up-to-date.## \ud83c\udf89 Accomplishments that we're proud of- **True Data Ownership**: We have successfully built a platform where patients have full control over their health data. The encryption model ensures that no one, not even the platform developers, can access patient data without their explicit permission.- **End-to-End Security**: The combination of client-side AES-GCM encryption and Internet Identity provides a highly secure environment for sensitive health information.- **Seamless User Experience**: Despite the complexity of the underlying cryptographic operations, we have managed to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface for both patients and providers.## \ud83d\udcda What we learned- **The Power of ICP**: We learned how to leverage the unique features of the Internet Computer, such as canister storage, Internet Identity, and the actor model, to build a truly decentralized application.- **Decentralized Application Architecture**: We gained valuable experience in designing and building applications where the \"backend\" is a set of smart contracts and the \"frontend\" is a secure, client-side application.- **Cryptography in Practice**: We moved beyond theoretical knowledge of encryption and learned how to implement it in a real-world application, dealing with key management, serialization, and the nuances of the Web Crypto API.## \ud83d\ude80 What's next for MediVet- **Mobile Application**: Develop a native mobile application for iOS and Android to improve accessibility.- **Integration with Wearables**: Allow users to connect their wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit) to automatically sync health data.- **AI-Powered Insights**: Explore the possibility of using privacy-preserving AI to provide patients with personalized health insights based on their data, without compromising their privacy.- **Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration**: Enhance our identity system by integrating with decentralized identity standards.- **Tokenization and Incentives**: Explore a token-based system to incentivize data sharing for research purposes, with the patient's consent.```",

    "Team description": "The traditional art market suffers from critical inefficiencies that hinder its growth and trustworthiness:- **Authentication is unreliable:** Certificates are often paper-based or stored in centralized systems, making them vulnerable to forgery, loss, or dispute.- **Provenance is opaque:** Ownership history and exhibition data are fragmented, making it difficult to verify an artwork\u2019s legitimacy or track its journey.- **Payments are complex and insecure:** Most transactions rely on intermediaries, adding cost and friction while limiting accessibility for emerging collectors.- **Royalties are mismanaged:** Artists rarely receive a fair share from secondary sales due to the lack of automation and transparency.- **Data collaboration is limited:** Key information about artworks is siloed across institutions, impeding cooperation and value creation.To solve these challenges, **Keyban** has developed the **Tokenized Art Passport (TAP)** in collaboration with **Urban Arts Magazine** and **Fisheye Magazine**. TAP is a blockchain-powered solution that:- Issues **tamper-proof digital certificates** linked to artworks, recorded permanently on the blockchain.- Creates a **digital passport** that evolves with each transaction or event (sale, exhibition, restoration), enabling reliable provenance tracking.- Facilitates **peer-to-peer payments** using stablecoins, with invisible wallet creation and email-based transfers for a seamless experience.- Automates **royalty distribution** to artists and stakeholders via programmable smart contracts.- Provides a **Wallet-as-a-Service** layer for collectors to store, manage, and resell artworks easily, even if they are not crypto-native.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfASDuo-QHy18DoCXswwwOi02Z35zgo0mt3nvmE-Rymxa3zL-J--qc_SGR5Iv61mo3pPay6li-LHnYDpC1puAGxEUJIvINZkh3Avj1oL9-Nb-GK0B7Vffoz1i3GGJCz34MlmvOs?key=A1CbvP7ZYC9UX3eYgoHPTA)###### ***Embedded Wallet Experience with Full Asset Control***Delivers secure and seamless blockchain access without exposing technical complexity:- Enables automatic wallet creation at user registration using Single Sign-On (SSO), removing the need for seed phrases or wallet extensions.- Ensures full user control over assets through a non-custodial architecture based on Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), where private keys are never reconstructed.- Executes all sensitive operations locally in the user\u2019s browser via a secure WebAssembly (WASM) module, guaranteeing isolation and tamper-resistance.- Exposes all wallet features via a developer-friendly SDK, allowing partners to integrate blockchain transactions effortlessly into existing user flows.###### ***Artwork Certification and Authenticity Verification***Creates a blockchain-anchored certificate to verify the authenticity of artworks:- Ensures each certificate is generated from the artwork\u2019s description and permanently recorded on the blockchain.- Allows verification via a QR code or NFC tag attached to the artwork, displaying the verified description and certifier\u2019s identity.- Provides an immutable and tamper-proof system, preventing forgery and ensuring trust in authentication records.- Provenance and Events Tracking- Provides an immutable, transparent record of an artwork\u2019s ownership history, exhibition events, and condition updates:- Enhances the value of artworks by establishing a trusted historical record.- Prevents fraud by providing verifiable authenticity and ownership history.- Enables collaboration based on data by allowing various actors (e.g., artists, galleries, institutions) to access and leverage information to generate value.###### ***Tokenized Product Passport (TPP)***\u00a0Extending the Tokenized Art Passport, the TPP infrastructure provides a blockchain-native, interoperable framework for managing artwork lifecycle and ownership with enhanced trust and security:- Creates a digital twin (NFT-based) of the artwork that includes certified metadata (artist, title, technique, dimensions, etc.) and is stored immutably on chain.- Captures and updates key lifecycle events\u2014such as exhibitions, restorations, transfers, and appraisals\u2014through role-based permissions granted to artists, galleries, and institutions.- Enables secure, traceable ownership transfers via non-custodial wallets created automatically for collectors and partners.- Ensures pseudonymous privacy while supporting interoperable verification across marketplaces, galleries, and institutions. ###### ***Peer-to-Peer Sales with Embedded Stablecoin Payments***Streamlines the sale of artworks through a fully integrated peer-to-peer payment flow powered by stablecoins:- The seller initiates a transfer by simply specifying the buyer\u2019s email address - no need for the buyer to already have a wallet or account.- Upon receiving the email, the buyer is invited to access the offer through a secure link. If not yet onboarded, the buyer is automatically provisioned with a non-custodial wallet via Single Sign-On (SSO), ensuring a seamless and secure experience.- The buyer is presented with the exact details of the offer and can either accept or decline it. Only the intended recipient is authorized to interact with the offer.- To finalize the purchase, the buyer can either pay directly in **Stablecoin** (if they already hold them in their wallet) or use an integrated fiat-to-crypto on-ramp that enables payment via credit card.Stablecoin provides several key advantages in this model:- They ensure atomic delivery-versus-payment, where the artwork transfer and payment occur in a single, inseparable transaction.- They offer greater transparency, enabling clearer audit trails and improving the resale value of artworks over time.- They are future-proof, aligned with the rapid adoption of digital currencies across wallets and payment platforms.- They reduce transaction costs, especially for users already holding stablecoins, and avoid the friction of traditional payment intermediaries.- This approach modernizes art sales by removing technical barriers, enabling direct and efficient transactions between collectors, and embedding financial transparency into the heart of the artwork lifecycle.###### ***Automated Royalty Payments and Programmable Loyalty***Implements programmable smart contracts that automate the distribution of royalties to entitled parties whenever an artwork is resold:- Royalties are defined once and stored on-chain, linked to each Tokenized Art Passport (TAP) through a dedicated Royalty Manager Contract, which acts as an index for all TAP NFTs.- Each resale triggers a contract-enforced payout according to the preconfigured royalty rules, ensuring artists, co-creators, estates, and institutions receive their share without intermediaries or manual reporting.- Royalty logic is fully transparent and immutable, increasing trust for all stakeholders and enabling more fluid resale dynamics.- Rules support complex scenarios with multiple beneficiaries and percentage-based allocations, programmable directly during TAP issuance or updated later with appropriate permissions.- The enforcement of royalties is embedded into the transfer logic of each NFT: standard transfers are disabled, and only authorized resale transactions\u2014executed via the P2P flow\u2014can trigger ownership changes. This guarantees that royalty rules are always respected.- The recipient of a TAP can only claim the NFT by following the secure resale link and completing the associated payment. This ensures compliance with the contract and prevents circumvention of royalty obligations.###### ***Go to Market***The project is backed by two major partners in the media/event/community space on these markets. Urban Arts Magazine \u2013 Strategic partner and leading media platform dedicated to street and urban art:[\u00a0https://www.urbanarts.fr](https://www.urbanarts.fr)Fisheye Magazine \u2013 Strategic partner and 360\u00b0 media group for photography, visual arts, and digital culture:[\u00a0https://fisheyemagazine.fr](https://fisheyemagazine.fr)Based on a key reference printed media of the sector, both of them address every month with their dedicated magazine read by close to 80 000 creators. As they are a 360\u00b0 media group, they enhance this capacity with social media (80K followers for the 1st one, 155K for the second one) and are sponsoring/organizing major arts events in France, Europe and even Latin America. Our partners will distribute under their label, the solution across their established communities of artists and art enthusiasts. TAP's marketing strategy is aligned with these partners, leveraging recurring media promotions, direct marketing to their audiences, and event activations such as exhibitions and vernissages.",

    "Team description": "## 1. Executive Summary**BetterTrade** is a **Bitcoin DeFi copilot composed of specialized, cooperating on\u2011chain AI agents** deployed as **ICP canisters**. It automates yield strategies (lending, liquidity provision, hedged vaults, basis trades) across Bitcoin\u2011enabled protocols, while continuously ingesting **market data, on\u2011chain signals, and sentiment feeds** to adapt positions in near\u2011real time. A dedicated **Risk Guard** enforces user\u2011defined capital protections.**Why now?** Bitcoin\u2019s expansion into DeFi (via wrapped BTC, Layer\u20112s, and native integrations) has created yield opportunities that remain opaque and operationally complex for most users. Simultaneously, the **Internet Computer\u2019s Bitcoin integration + t\u2011ECDSA** enables trust\u2011minimized, programmatic Bitcoin transactions *without custodial bridges*. BetterTrade marries these innovations with **AI\u2011driven decisioning** to unlock smart, automated participation.**Hackathon MVP Scope:** Deliver a **two\u2011agent vertical slice**: (1) **Strategy Selector** suggesting one of a few pre\u2011coded strategies; (2) **Execution Agent** that submits a Bitcoin transaction (mock or live testnet) using ICP\u2019s Bitcoin API + threshold ECDSA signing. Minimal dashboard shows status, logs, and PnL simulation.**Expansion Path:** Add Market Monitor, Sentiment, and Risk Guard agents; broaden supported strategies; expose SDK so external dApps can call agents as services.---## 2. Problem StatementBitcoin holders face three core frictions when trying to earn yield across emerging Bitcoin DeFi venues:1. **Discovery Complexity:** Dozens of protocols (lending markets, yield vaults, RWA\u2011backed loans, liquidity pools on BTC L2s) with rapidly changing rates.2. **Operational Overhead:** Moving BTC across layers, signing transactions, rebalancing collateral ratios, harvesting rewards.3. **Risk Blindspots:** Volatility spikes, liquidity droughts, protocol hacks, custodial / bridge risk, liquidation thresholds.As a result, most holders either remain idle (opportunity cost) or rely on centralized yield products (custodial risk, opaque fees).**We need an autonomous, transparent, user\u2011governable system that actively manages Bitcoin DeFi positions for risk\u2011adjusted yield.**---## 3.

Also, we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming platforms.### ProblemThe traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:- **User Adoption:** Existing platforms struggle to bring new users into Web3 due to complex interfaces, complicated wallets, bad UI/UX and difficult infra.- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** Many platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.### SolutionAPT-Casino addresses these problems by offering:- **Seamless User Adoption:** By building fully on-chain on the ICP blockchain with super simple UI/UX, we offer an easy, familiar entry point for billions to experience Web3 gaming and gambling, no external apps, complex wallets, or barriers.- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilizing the ICP on-chain randomness module within the ICP Ecosystem we ensure all game outcomes are transparent and verifiably fair.![APT-Casino - Analog pptx (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3549c792-a64e-47a1-b0f7-74d98332af39)- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users with unrestricted access to their funds.- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and Clean bonus terms without hidden traps.- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralized asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.### Key Perspectives**APT-Casino** offers a multifaceted platform with 2 perspectives:**1. GameFi - Gaming Aspect:**- **APT-Casino** is a fully functional on-chain Casino.- Users can place various types of bets over a range of games but as a POC we have developed Roulette, Mines and Wheel of Spin. - Roulette game is based on \"European Roulette Rules\" More detailed information is presented below every game page, the roulette has **straight, split, street, corner, six line, column, dozen, red, black, high, low, even, and odd.**- The **roulette wheel** randomly generates winning values.- Winnings are automatically calculated and transferred to the users wallet on ICP Chain.**2. Defi - Lending Aspect:**- Users can **deposit ICP tokens as collateral to borrow in game currency that is APTC** such that if the user holding is in APT and if APT goes up by 10% then the value of the collateral goes up by 10% and users can enjoy playing games/ gambling without facing any financial losses as the in-game currency(APTC) is stable and has nothing to deal with collateral.- Facilitates gameplay without the need to sell existing holdings.- Ensures players have the necessary assets to participate in games seamlessly using real-time asset prices.**Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of fully on-chain games, including roulette, mines, wheel of luck, blackjack, plinko, and more. As a (POC) Proof of Concept we developed fully on-chain Roulette but a similar model can be applied to introduce the new casino games to the platform.![APT-Casino - Analog pptx (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b7d30fb-635e-441a-95db-3b36c6127bdf)![APT-Casino - Analog pptx (4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d51e897d-3129-4998-b7ca-67b4cdd04704)![APT-Casino - Analog pptx (7)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff51e16-ceed-44da-b27d-2d925b4d62e0)### ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUe0ZDkcQIArZkDQFCrH3J3qehGAQpADixIEULdv6JpTvLrlp_qD4mqv4hsfYiPyOHTGdTvERy2xHMyWq__w47Vyuq3jWvzx8dO8SSDi7zPnVKG5PukhhyVtMDzf0Yjy-MO3vzrpSg=s2048?key=pkydg80DaB6-LkFqaBTLYA)Our Sources of Revenue- **Transaction Fees:** 0.1% fees on bets, asset trades, and withdrawals across the platform.- **NFT Sale:** Revenue from the sale of in-game NFTs and digital assets.- **Advertising:** Partnered promotions, priority visibility and in-game advertising opportunities.- **DeFi Products:** Fees generated from APTC - staking, yield farming, and liquidity pool mining activities.- **Premium Features:** Offering users access to exclusive games or features through paid upgrades or subscriptions.### What's nextAll though started as an idea but now we are thinking of carrying it forward as a business model and expanding further.- Mainnet Launch: Deploying on the ICP mainnet for real-world use.- User Testing: Conducting extensive user testing to refine the platform, we conducted 1000 user testing on ICP Testnet.- Promoting the Product: Marketing to attract a wider audience.- Introducing 24 new games to the platform in the next 6 months.- Explore additional DeFi features like staking, farming, and yield strategies to offer more financial services within the platform.- We aim to implement gasless transactions to enhance user convenience.- Bringing in new monetization schemas to compensate the casino games/ game creators.- Having an in-built live streaming, for gameplay we may utilize livepeer/ lens/ huddle01 for this feature and allow players to do streaming within the application just like pump.fun.- We also plan to introduce an in-game chat feature where gamblers/ gamers/ our users can chat and predict the outcome of the games making its perspective and narrative towards SOCIALFI as well.We want to Be the biggest gamefi/ gambling / games hub centre of the gaming and gambling industry.",

    "Team description": "**FactoryBot** is an AI-powered system that optimizes 3D printing workflows by intelligently determining the print order based on the complexity of each model. Traditional 3D printing queues often operate sequentially or rely on manual prioritization, which can lead to inefficient time management, unnecessary delays, and wasted resources. FactoryBot addresses this by analyzing uploaded 3D model files (such as STL or OBJ), evaluating their geometric complexity using advanced heuristics, and then prioritizing print jobs to optimize production flow.The system includes a real-time monitoring dashboard, a complexity detection engine, and an intelligent print job scheduler. It can integrate with existing 3D printing software like OctoPrint or Klipper to provide live printer feedback and control. On the technical side, FactoryBot is built using a Python backend (with STL parsing and geometry analysis), a React-based UI for monitoring, and cloud-based databases like Firebase or Supabase for job tracking. A custom-built algorithm calculates design complexity based on mesh density, overhangs, support requirements, and estimated print time.This solution significantly reduces downtime, improves printer utilization, and supports smarter decision-making in digital manufacturing environments. In the next phase, the team plans to refine complexity scoring using machine learning, add material and cost optimization layers, and scale the platform to support multiple 3D printers. FactoryBot is ideal for prototyping labs, print farms, and smart factories aiming to increase productivity and reduce waste through intelligent automation.",

It\u2019s built for indie hackers, startups, and small teams that need fast feedback but don\u2019t have time for complex tools like Typeform. With SmartFormAI, users just describe what they want to learn-our AI generates the questions, builds the form, and prepares it for instant sharing and analysis. What problem does it solve?Creating surveys is often slow, repetitive, and expensive-especially with traditional tools that require design or coding. SmartFormAI removes those barriers by allowing anyone to create powerful, feedback-driven surveys in seconds. It\u2019s perfect for testing product ideas, gathering early feedback, or running audience research without the overhead of complex tools. Hypothesis for Product-Market Fit:SmartFormAI is built for solo builders, indie developers, creators, and lean teams who want fast validation for their ideas. The hypothesis: these users are tired of expensive, bloated tools and would adopt a simpler, cheaper alternative to Typeform if it offers comparable results in less time.Validation So Far:So far, I\u2019ve validated the idea by researching successful tools like Typeform, Tally, and BlockSurvey, identifying gaps, and asking for feedback from real users on Twitter. I soft-launched SmartFormAI and was selected as #4 Product of the Day on Fazier. I also launched on Product Hunt and received positive feedback from early users who praised its speed and ease of use. Next Steps:If we gain more traction and feedback during this hackathon, I plan to:Add AI-powered quiz generationOffer customization options like theming and brandingImprove analytics with visual insightsExpand integrations and export optionsAbout Me:Hi!

This decentralized approach ensures uncensorable, always-available data, vital for everyday navigation, community building, and especially crucial during emergencies or in regions underserved by traditional mapping services. We're building the foundation for a truly resilient, community-driven spatial data commons, where every contribution strengthens collective awareness.**I. Introduction**Traditional mapping services, while ubiquitous, are centralized. This centralization introduces vulnerabilities: data can be controlled, censored, or become unavailable due to corporate decisions or technical failures. In emerging economies or during crises, access to accurate, real-time, local information can be a matter of safety and efficiency. DecentraMap proposes a radical shift: a mapping platform where the map data and its infrastructure are owned and governed by the community it serves. Leveraging the unique capabilities of the Internet Computer (ICP), DecentraMap will provide a robust, resilient, and truly decentralized alternative.**II. Core Vision & Problem Solved****The Problem:**- **Centralized Control:** Existing maps are controlled by large tech companies, leading to potential data censorship, single points of failure, and data harvesting without user consent or compensation.- **Information Lag/Gaps:** Official maps can be slow to update on highly localized, ephemeral events (e.g., flash floods, temporary road repairs, pop-up community events).- **Accessibility in Crisis:** Centralized services can be disrupted during natural disasters or conflicts, precisely when reliable local information is most critical.- **Lack of Hyper-Local Nuance:** Corporate maps may not prioritize or capture granular, community-specific details that are vital for residents.**DecentraMap's Solution (Vision):** DecentraMap transforms mapping into a **public utility, a digital commons**. By hosting the entire application stack (frontend, backend logic, and data) on ICP, we ensure:- **Uncensorable Data:** Information cannot be removed or altered by any single entity.- **High Availability:** The map remains accessible even if individual nodes or data centers go offline, due to ICP's distributed nature.- **Community Ownership & Governance:** The power to shape the map, define data standards, and moderate content shifts from corporations to the users themselves, fostering genuine collaboration.- **Real-Time Relevance:** Citizens can directly contribute and verify information, leading to immediate updates on local conditions.- **Global Reach, Local Impact:** A scalable decentralized network allows any community, anywhere, to benefit from and contribute to their own map data.",

    "Team description": "# Sol-Shift: The Future of Energy is Tradable**Sol-Shift** is a **decentralized marketplace** built entirely on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** that allows solar panel owners to **tokenize** their future **energy production**. This unlocks instant liquidity for green asset owners and creates a new, verifiable, real-world asset class for DeFi.## The Problem: Trapped Value on Every RoofMillions of homeowners have **invested** in **solar panels**, creating a massive, distributed network of green energy production. However, the value they generate is trapped. They are forced to sell their excess energy to a single buyer\u2014the utility company\u2014at a fixed rate, with **payouts** that **are slow and inflexible**. They have no way to access the future value of their investment today or hedge against changing energy prices. This illiquidity is a major barrier to accelerating the adoption of renewable energy.## Our Solution: The Forward Energy NFT (feNFT)**Sol-Shift** unlocks this trapped value by allowing homeowners to mint a **Forward Energy NFT (feNFT)**.An **feNFT** is a digital contract representing a commitment to deliver a specific amount of energy (e.g., 100 kWh) to the grid during a future time period (e.g., \"August 2025\").Once minted, this feNFT can be sold on the Sol-Shift marketplace to a global pool of buyers, including:->**DeFI Investors** speculating on future energy prices.-> **Corporations** looking to verifiably offset their carbon footprint.-> **Energy Companies** seeking to acquire Renewable Energy Certificates.-> **Eco-conscious Individuals** wanting to directly support green energy producers.This process gives the solar owner **immediate capital** and creates a transparent, competitive market for renewable energy futures.## Why It MUST Be BUILT on ICPBuilding **Sol-Shift** on a traditional blockchain would be slow, expensive, and require centralized oracles, defeating the purpose of decentralization. ICP provides a unique tech stack that makes this project possible:- **HTTPS Outcalls:** This is our secret sauce. Our Oracle Canister can directly and securely call the APIs of smart solar inverters (like SolarEdge or Enphase) to verify energy production data. This completely removes the need for a costly, centralized oracle service.- **Reverse Gas Model:**\u00a0Homeowners and investors can use the platform without holding tokens for gas fees. This is critical for onboarding non-crypto-native users and achieving mass adoption.- **100% On-Chain:** The entire dApp\u2014frontend, backend logic, and user data\u2014is hosted directly on-chain, providing unparalleled security, transparency, and censorship resistance.- **Speed & Scalability:**\u00a0ICP's millisecond finality allows us to build a marketplace that feels as fast and responsive as a modern Web2 application.## How It Works: The Sol-Shift FlowOur system is composed of several canisters working in concert to create a seamless user experience.1. **Verify (The Oracle Canister):** A homeowner connects their wallet and provides an API key for their solar device. Our Oracle Canister uses HTTPS Outcalls to query their device, verifying ownership and analyzing historical production data to calculate a provably achievable energy output for a future month.2. **Mint (The feNFT Canister):** Based on the verified data, the homeowner mints an feNFT representing their future energy commitment (e.g., 100 kWh for August 2025). The NFT's metadata includes the delivery terms and a link to the verification proof.3. **Trade (The Marketplace Canister):** The feNFT is listed on our marketplace. A buyer can purchase it, with the funds held in escrow by the canister.4. **Settle (Oracle + Marketplace):**\u00a0After the delivery period has passed, the Oracle Canister automatically calls the solar device API again to confirm the actual energy produced. If successful, the Marketplace Canister releases the escrowed funds to the homeowner, completing the swap.## Key Innovations:- **Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization:**\u00a0We are turning an intangible future commodity\u2014solar energy\u2014into a liquid, tradable on-chain asset.- **DePIN for Energy:**\u00a0We are creating a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network that incentivizes the growth and reliability of distributed renewable energy grids.- **New DeFi Primitive:**\u00a0We are introducing energy futures as a new, green, and yield-bearing asset class for the entire DeFi ecosystem.**Sol-Shift** is **more than a DeFi app**; it's a bridge to a more **efficient**, **decentralized**, and **green energy future**, powered by the unique capabilities of the **Internet Computer**.",

    "Team description": "The vision behind \"Rejoul\" is to address the fundamental problems in the traditional academic journal review process, which is often centralized, slow, and opaque. Currently, the process is controlled by a handful of large publishers, creating a 'black box' where authors often lack visibility into the status or fairness of their reviews. This process can take months, hindering the dissemination of knowledge. Furthermore, the crucial contributions of reviewers are often unappreciated or even poorly recorded.Rejoul envisions a fairer and more efficient ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology, \"Rejoul\" creates a decentralized system where every step\u2014from submission and review to revision\u2014is recorded transparently and immutably. This not only builds trust but also allows for tracking the contributions of each reviewer, paving the way for a fair incentive system. The platform simplifies interaction, connecting authors and reviewers directly to accelerate the process, ensure integrity, and ultimately speed up the pace of scientific innovation for everyone involved.",

Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with\u00a0`RateStar`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```cd RateStar/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locally[](https://github.com/bachnthanh/rate-star#running-the-project-locally)If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at\u00a0`http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```npm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run\u00a0`dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```npm start```Which will start a server at\u00a0`http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variables[](https://github.com/bachnthanh/rate-star#note-on-frontend-environment-variables)If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0to\u00a0`ic`\u00a0if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace\u00a0`process.env.DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0in the autogenerated declarations    - Setting\u00a0`canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string`\u00a0in\u00a0`dfx.json`\u00a0will replace\u00a0`process.env.DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own\u00a0`createActor`\u00a0constructor",

Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.To learn more before you start working with\u00a0`ChronoX`, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:```javascriptcd ChronoX/dfx helpdfx canister --help```## Running the project locally[](https://github.com/nguyenminhkhai98/chronox#running-the-project-locally)If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```javascript# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```Once the job completes, your application will be available at\u00a0`http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```javascriptnpm run generate```at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run\u00a0`dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```javascriptnpm start```Which will start a server at\u00a0`http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variables[](https://github.com/nguyenminhkhai98/chronox#note-on-frontend-environment-variables)If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0to\u00a0`ic`\u00a0if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace\u00a0`process.env.DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0in the autogenerated declarations    - Setting\u00a0```javascriptcanisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string```in\u00a0`dfx.json`\u00a0will replace\u00a0`process.env.DFX_NETWORK`\u00a0with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own\u00a0`createActor`\u00a0constructor",

Humidity Logic (using Sensors*)- If humidity is above 60%, set mode to \"Dry Mode\"- If humidity is 60% or below, set mode to \"Cool Mode\"#### \ud83e\uddcd 3. Fan Speed Based on Number of People (using Thermal Sensors*)- If number of people = 0 or 1, set fan speed to \"Low\"- If number of people = 2 or 3, set fan speed to \"Medium\"- If number of people = 4 or more, set fan speed to \"High\"#### \ud83d\udca4 4. Sleep Mode Logic- Condition:- If movement = No and time is between 9 PM and 6 AM- Then:- Set mode to \"Sleep Mode\"- Increase AC temperature by 2\u00b0C#### \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f 5. Flap Direction Logic (Clock-Based Input) (Thermal Sensor*)- If position includes multiple clock directions (e.g., \"10o, 2o\"), set flap direction to \"Rotate\"- If position is 12o, set direction to \"Middle\"- If position is between 10o and 11o, set direction to \"Left\"- If position is between 1o and 2o, set direction to \"Right\"- For all other cases, default to \"Middle\"Explanation: Flap direction aligns with person\u2019s location to optimize airflow.#### \u2699\ufe0f 6.

    "Team description": "# OPTICWe are proposing a fully on-chain chat application that embodies what chat rooms in web3 are suppose to look like built on the self-writing internet.## Table of Contents- [The Web3 Way](#the-web3-way)- [Additional Features](#additional-features)- [Canister Topology & Architecture](#canister-topology--architecture)- [Optic Backend Canister](#optic-backend-canister)-  [Optic Agent Canister](#optic-agent-canister)-  [Architecture](#architecture)- [Local Setup](#local-setup)- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)- [Revenue](#revenue)- [Limitations and Improvements](#limitations-and-improvements)## The Web3 WayOptics is a chat and messaging application that allows users to go interact with each other in a decentralized and secure manner, while still earning from their interactions. Using our platform users can convert their local chat room into a decentralized investment pool accepting interval contributions from members. All the contributions are routes to the agent canister which integrates ICPSwapv3 to:- Get top pools from ICPSwap and evaluate the tokens needed- Swaps a relevant amount of the desired tokens in the chosen pools- Provides liquidity to the desired poolAll member contributions are recorded on the main storage canister and each member is allocated a share percentage the total rewards earned from fees in the pool the agent invested in. This share is relative to the amount the user contributed and the total amount invested in the pool by the agent. Additionally we use this share to calculate how much in rewards the user can claim.The user can request to claim their rewards at any time. Leaving a chat room is the same as withdrawing all the contributions you have made on the said room plus the total amount of uncollected fees. This action reduces a user's share as well.## Additional FeaturesApart from making DeFi as easy as making a contribution, Optic also has other features that we believe adds value to the ICP ecosystem and improve blockchain adoption as well. These include:- Clean wallet UI and Dashboard that enables users manage their chain-key tokens- AI Debriefing agent built into the notifications system of the user for summary provision## Canister Topology & ArchitectureAs discussed before, Optic opted for a multi canister approach in order to sepparate the CRUD part of the application with the business login. Our dApp utilizes 2 canisters that communicate and sync with each other to deliver value to the user.### Optic Backend CanisterThis is the canister in charge of all the CRUD and authentication functions. It's written in [Azle](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/the_azle_book.html) and also serves as the storage canister. Deployed here `not yet deployed`.Main-net canister id: `not yet deployed`### Optic Agent CanisterThe Optic agent canister houses the business logic of our platform. This is the main canister that handles users' funds, analyzes available pools on ICPSwap, performs swaps to get the right tokens for liquidity provision, collects fees once requested. Works closey with the backend canister for actions such as contribution, share calculations etc.It's written in ICP's native language [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/build-on-btc/) and main net canister is:Deployed `not yet deployed`.### ArchitectureOptic follows a **multi-canister microservices architecture** designed for scalability, security, and maintainability. The system is built on the Internet Computer blockchain with two main canisters that work together to provide a seamless DeFi-enabled chat experience.## Local Setup### Prerequisites- Nodejs at least version 20- IC SDK installed. [Installation Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install)- Plug wallet extension installed, [Guide](https://plugwallet.ooo/)1. Fork and clone this repository```javascriptgit clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/optic.git``````javascriptor alternatively clone it directly``````javascriptgit clone https://github.com/divin3circle/optic.git```2. Install dependencies```javascriptcd optic && pnpm install```> advisable to also install dependencies from the frontend dir```javascriptcd src/frontend && pnpm install```3. Deploy the canisters locally and run the development server> at the project root run```javascriptdfx start --clean --background dfx deploy && cd src/frontend pnpm run dev```4. Follow guide [here](https://github.com/divin3circle/optic_agent) to set up Optic agent> optic agent needs to be deployed on the playground to avoid cross subnet calls errors## RevenueOur platform will have a couple of ways to generate revenue:- Each chat room creation will cost a small fee and part of it will be used to fund the chat room\u2019s canister with cycles.- After every withdrawal from the pool the platform will charge a service fee based on the earnings.- User specific agent will be charged on a prompt basis or via a freemium model.## Limitations and Improvements1. All funds are currently being routed to a single treasury canister, each chat room needs to be canister on it's own, and handle it's funds, this includes swapping, liquidity provision, fee collection etc.2. Parameters of a room are set in stone. Members of a chat room need to have a DAO like relationship where a proposal can be made to update the chat room's settings.3. No user verification done, for KYC. Need to implement an OTP via mobile number for verification.4. Currently only one pool is supported(ICP/ckUSDC) and users can only contribute using the said tokens. Allow multi-token contribution to diversify pool investment.*Optic offers a uniques angle for users on the ICP network. By bridging the DeFi gap using a fully on-chain social messaging up, we're making blockchain adoption and usage intuitive.*",

Why?**In today\u2019s world, digital spaces are fast, noisy, and shallow. People scroll endlessly, react instantly, and rarely feel **heard** or **truly connected**. Social media platforms prioritize speed and virality over depth and meaning \u2014 leading to burnout, performative posts, and a loss of authentic human expression.We believe there\u2019s a better way:**What if technology could foster reflection, patience, and emotional depth?**What if **strangers could connect slowly, intentionally, and anonymously across time?****\ud83d\udcec What?****ChainMail** is a fully on-chain platform where users write **anonymous, time-locked letters** to future strangers.- You write a message (no identity, no likes, no pressure).- It\u2019s **time-locked** to be unlocked by someone else after **1 month or 1 year**.- When your letter unlocks, you receive one from another stranger.- You **must reflect or respond** before sending another \u2014 ensuring depth over volume.It\u2019s a **chain of trust, memory, and reflection** enabled by crypto, not corrupted by it.**\u2699\ufe0f How?**ChainMail is built using:- \ud83e\udde0 **Rust-based smart contracts** for time-lock logic and on-chain message queues- \ud83c\udfb2 **Random matchmaker engine** \u2014 trustlessly assigns messages to future strangers- \u26d3\ufe0f **Fully on-chain architecture** \u2014 messages, timestamps, and responses are permanent- \u2728 **Pastel, minimalist frontend** \u2014 inspired by journals and old-school penpal letters- \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f **Enforced message delay** \u2014 no \"next message\" until you\u2019ve sat with what you got\u00a0\ud83c\udf1f Key Innovations- Social - Reflective, one-to-one communication vs. performative, one-to-many feeds- Fully on Chain - All logic and content time-locked and matched on-chain \u2014 no servers required- Message Protocol - Enforced reply-before-send mechanic, uncommon in web3 social products- Design Philosophy - Emotional UX \u2014 soft, calm, and deeply human\u00a0**\ud83d\ude80 What\u2019s Next?**- \ud83d\udce1 ENS support for optional sender reveal- \ud83e\udde0 AI-assisted

By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain technology \u2013 transparency, immutability, and enhanced security \u2013 decentralized AI offers groundbreaking solutions to long-standing challenges in these critical fields.### **Transforming Healthcare with Trust and Privacy**The healthcare industry grapples with the immense responsibility of managing highly sensitive patient data while striving for advancements in treatment and research. Decentralized AI on ICP presents a robust framework to address these complexities:- **Decentralized Medical Records:** Imagine a future where your medical data is truly yours. AI models running as secure \"canisters\" on ICP can analyze anonymized patient data stored directly on-chain. This allows for the identification of critical disease patterns, accurate prediction of outbreaks, and the development of highly personalized treatment plans. Crucially, the decentralized nature ensures that patient data remains private and tamper-proof, with access strictly controlled by the patient, thereby resolving the pressing privacy concerns prevalent in traditional healthcare systems.- **Accelerating Drug Discovery & Research:** The arduous journey of drug discovery can be significantly accelerated by AI analyzing vast datasets of chemical compounds and biological interactions. Decentralized AI fosters a new paradigm for collaborative research. Different parties can securely contribute data and AI models without centralizing sensitive intellectual property, creating more transparent, secure, and collaborative research environments.- **Personalized Medicine with Data Sovereignty:** AI holds the key to unlocking truly personalized medicine by processing individual genomic, lifestyle, and health data. Running these powerful AI algorithms on a decentralized platform like ICP guarantees an individual's data sovereignty, preventing unauthorized use or commercialization of their sensitive health information.![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-23 at 9.33.31 PM.jpeg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/19838079a66051e7c1d32ea410483d20.jpeg)### **Fortifying Finance with Transparency and Resilience**![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-23 at 9.39.32 PM.jpeg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198380c9cdfdbde2b9c7a654ad9ab5fa.jpeg)The financial sector demands unwavering trust, robust security, and the ability to detect and prevent illicit activities swiftly. Decentralized AI on ICP offers a compelling suite of applications to meet these needs:- **Enhanced Fraud Detection and Prevention:** Decentralized AI can revolutionize how financial systems combat fraud. Machine learning models deployed as canisters on ICP can monitor blockchain transactions in real-time, meticulously analyzing patterns to detect and flag suspicious activities like potential fraud, money laundering, or other illicit behaviors. This significantly enhances security and trust within financial systems by eliminating reliance on a single, vulnerable central authority.- **Fair and Transparent Decentralized Lending & Borrowing (DeFi):** In the burgeoning world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), AI can play a pivotal role in assessing creditworthiness and optimizing interest rates. Decentralized AI ensures that these crucial algorithms are transparent and fair, effectively mitigating the risks of bias or manipulation often observed in traditional financial algorithms.- **Robust Risk Management:** AI models are invaluable for analyzing market data, predicting trends, and assessing risks for decentralized investment platforms or trading strategies. By being decentralized, the AI's operations are fully auditable and inherently resilient to single points of failure, instilling greater confidence and stability in financial decision-making.- **Efficient Algorithmic Trading:** Decentralized AI agents can execute sophisticated trading strategies autonomously on-chain, reacting to market conditions in a trustless and transparent manner. This has the potential to lead to more efficient, equitable, and resilient financial markets.![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-23 at 9.36.16 PM.jpeg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198380b72d526a75501665e401f86d62.jpeg)**The ICP Advantage: Security, Privacy, and Unwavering Trust**In both healthcare and finance, the fundamental advantage of decentralized AI running on ICP lies in its ability to harness powerful AI capabilities while upholding the absolute highest standards of security, privacy, transparency, and resistance to censorship or manipulation. ICP's unique architecture, including the ability to run computation and store data entirely on-chain, and features like the \"Reverse Gas Model\" (where developers, not users, pay for computation), make it an ideal foundation for building the next generation of secure, private, and trust-minimized AI applications. As we move forward, decentralized AI on ICP is set to redefine what's possible in these vital sectors, fostering a future where innovation and integrity go hand in hand.![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-23 at 9.27.26 PM.jpeg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/19838032556cde389c1f51241c1b6ea6.jpeg)",

These barriers limit accessibility and efficiency. DIC removes these constraints by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies to automate governance, enforce rules transparently, and ensure equitable participation for all members, regardless of geography or background.Each club on the platform can be customized with its own investment strategy, membership structure, and voting rules. Members can propose investment opportunities, stake tokens, and vote on decisions using built-in DAO tools. Smart contracts automatically execute the outcomes, eliminating the risk of human error or manipulation. Profits, losses, and all transaction data are recorded immutably on-chain, providing complete auditability and security.The platform supports various investment avenues, including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi assets, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate or art. In the future, DIC aims to integrate with traditional finance through tokenized securities and compliant on-chain mechanisms.Whether you're a crypto-native investor or a newcomer seeking collective financial empowerment, Decentralized Investment Clubs provides an accessible, secure, and community-driven environment to grow wealth together.",

EduAid uses **smart contracts**, **AI**, and **localized verifiers** (teachers, chiefs) to build community trust and track every supported student's journey.The ProblemContext in Kenya & Africa: Millions Locked Out of EducationAcross **Kenya**, **over 1 million students** are at risk of dropping out each year \u2014not because they lack talent, but because they **lack access to basic educational needs**:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 School Fees\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanitary Pads\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Books & Uniforms\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mentorship & GuidanceThis crisis hits rural and underserved communities the hardest,where even a small financial setback can end a child\u2019s education permanently.\u00a0**Meanwhile, thousands of sponsors want to help\u2026 but face 3 major blockers**:1. **No Trusted Verification**There\u2019s no reliable way to confirm who genuinely needs support.**2.

Sertifikat diberikan kepada peserta yang tidak benar-benar hadir.2. Adanya manipulasi data kehadiran oleh pihak internal atau peserta.3. Kesulitan memverifikasi keabsahan sertifikat, terutama untuk pihak ketiga seperti institusi atau penyelenggara lanjutan.4. Kurangnya transparansi dan audit trail yang dapat diverifikasi secara independen.- Solusi yang Diusulkan:1. Menggunakan teknologi blockchain untuk mencatat kehadiran peserta secara permanen, transparan, dan tidak dapat dimanipulasi.2. Setiap peserta yang hadir akan mendapatkan hash sertifikat digital sebagai bukti kehadiran yang tercatat di blockchain. 3. Sertifikat tersebut dapat diverifikasi publik melalui sistem verifikasi berbasis hash di blockchain explorer atau dashboard khusus. 4. Untuk seminar online, kehadiran dicatat secara otomatis saat peserta masuk melalui link zoom dan backend akan membaca jika seseorang join dengan mendapatkan response webhook dari zoom. 5. Untuk seminar offline, kehadiran dicatat dengan memindai QR Code yang telah terverifikasi oleh sistem panitia. Dengan pendekatan ini, kita dapat meningkatkan kepercayaan, keamanan, dan validitas dari proses kehadiran dan penerbitan sertifikat kegiatan.",

It leverages a governance token to represent voting power and uses **Snapshot**, an open-source voting platform, to facilitate transparent and scalable community governance.---### \ud83d\udd27 **How It Works:**1. **Governance Token Issuance**    - Tokens are distributed to stakeholders (e.g., investors, community members, contributors).    - Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held.2. **Proposal Creation**    - Anyone holding a minimum number of tokens (as defined by the community rules) can submit a governance proposal.3. **Snapshot Voting**    - Uses **Snapshot** to take a \u201csnapshot\u201d of token holdings at a specific block height.    - Token holders vote based on their balances at that snapshot \u2014 eliminating vote manipulation by last-minute token transfers.4. **Gasless & Off-Chain**    - Voting occurs off-chain, meaning no gas fees are required.    - Results are transparent, cryptographically verifiable, and stored for reference.5. **Execution (Optional)**    - Voting outcomes can guide DAO decisions, initiate treasury actions, or trigger on-chain governance if integrated with smart contracts.---### \ud83d\ude80 **Key Benefits:**- **Gasless Voting:** No transaction fees for voters.- **Decentralized Power:** True community-driven governance.- **Efficient Scaling:** Off-chain voting handles large communities without congesting the blockchain.- **Security & Trust:** Snapshot ensures integrity of voting records with signed messages.- **Flexibility:** Ideal for DAOs, DeFi protocols, NFT communities, and Web3 projects.---### \ud83c\udfc1 **Use Cases:**- Treasury allocation decisions- Protocol upgrade proposals- Delegate or representative voting- Community grant distributions- DAO structure or policy changes",

As cities expand and the number of vehicles on the roads increases, traditional traffic systems struggle to keep up, especially during peak hours.Smart-Traffic-Predict addresses this problem by using real-time data from street cameras to predict traffic congestion on specific roads at specific times. This empowers commuters with accurate, timely information so they can make smarter travel decisions \u2014 whether to proceed, delay their trip, or choose an alternative route.To ensure data reliability, transparency, and high performance, Smart-Traffic-Predict is integrated with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). By deploying backend services as decentralized smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer, the system benefits from tamper-proof data storage, scalable real-time analytics, and a user interface that is hosted directly on-chain.

Named after the Sanskrit word \"Artha\" meaning wealth and prosperity, Arta Wallet embodies our vision of bringing financial prosperity to everyone, everywhere, without the barriers imposed by traditional banking systems.At its core, Arta Wallet solves the fundamental problem of financial exclusion and expensive cross-border payments. Today, over 1.7 billion people worldwide remain unbanked, while traditional payment processors charge exorbitant fees ranging from 3-5% per transaction and can take days to process international transfers. Small businesses in developing countries face even greater challenges, often unable to access global markets due to payment infrastructure limitations.Arta Wallet eliminates these barriers by creating a completely decentralized payment infrastructure that operates entirely on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional payment systems that rely on banks and financial intermediaries, Arta Wallet enables direct peer-to-peer transactions through an intuitive QR code system that anyone with a smartphone can use.**Technical Innovation**The current MVP version of Arta Wallet showcases groundbreaking technical capabilities that set it apart from existing payment solutions. Built entirely on Internet Computer Protocol, the application demonstrates true Web3 architecture by hosting everything on-chain - from the Rust-based smart contracts handling payment logic to the React frontend interface that users interact with.One of Arta Wallet's most innovative features is its real-time exchange rate integration using ICP's HTTPS outcall functionality. This allows the system to fetch live cryptocurrency exchange rates directly from CoinGecko API without relying on external oracles or centralized services. The application currently supports six major global currencies including USD, EUR, IDR, JPY, GBP, and SGD, with automatic conversion to ICP for blockchain-native transactions.The QR code payment system represents a perfect fusion of familiar technology with blockchain innovation. Users can generate payment QR codes for any amount in their preferred fiat currency, and the system automatically calculates the equivalent ICP value based on real-time market rates. This approach makes cryptocurrency payments as simple as scanning a code, removing the complexity that typically intimidates mainstream users.The backend architecture utilizes advanced stable storage structures to ensure data persistence across canister upgrades, while implementing sophisticated caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce costs. The system includes comprehensive rate limiting and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability even during high network traffic or external API unavailability.**Current Capabilities and User Experience**Arta Wallet's current version provides a complete payment experience that demonstrates the full potential of decentralized finance. Users begin their journey by connecting to the platform through a streamlined registration process that generates a unique wallet identity. The intuitive dashboard presents three main functionalities: payment generation, transaction processing, and history tracking.The payment generation workflow is remarkably simple yet powerful. Users enter the desired amount in their preferred currency, and Arta Wallet instantly generates a scannable QR code containing all necessary payment information. The QR code is not just a simple text string but a comprehensive payment package that includes the recipient's wallet address, exact ICP amount calculated from real-time exchange rates, and optional memo fields for transaction references.When processing payments, Arta Wallet simulates the complete transaction flow that will be integrated with real wallet providers in future versions. The current mock implementation demonstrates instant payment confirmation, automatic transaction recording on the blockchain, and real-time status updates. Every transaction is permanently recorded with complete transparency, creating an immutable audit trail that builds trust and accountability.The transaction history feature provides users with comprehensive visibility into their payment activities. All transactions are displayed with detailed information including timestamps, amounts in both fiat and ICP values, transaction IDs, and current status. This transparency is a key differentiator from traditional payment systems where users often lack visibility into transaction processing.**Competitive Advantages and Market Position**Arta Wallet's competitive positioning stems from its unique combination of blockchain technology with user-friendly design. Traditional payment processors like Stripe, PayPal, and Square charge substantial fees, impose geographic restrictions, and maintain the power to freeze accounts without warning. Arta Wallet eliminates these issues by operating on a decentralized network where no single entity controls the payment flow.Compared to existing cryptocurrency payment solutions, Arta Wallet offers superior user experience through its fiat currency integration. While other crypto payment systems require users to understand complex wallet addresses and cryptocurrency denominations, Arta Wallet allows people to think in familiar fiat terms while leveraging blockchain benefits behind the scenes.The Internet Computer Protocol foundation provides Arta Wallet with unique advantages over solutions built on other blockchains. ICP's reverse gas model means users don't pay transaction fees, making micro-payments economically viable. The ability to host frontend applications directly on-chain eliminates dependence on traditional web hosting, creating a truly decentralized experience.**Future Development Roadmap**The evolution of Arta Wallet is planned across multiple phases, each expanding capabilities and user adoption. Version 2 will introduce Internet Identity integration, replacing the current mock authentication with ICP's native identity system. This upgrade will enable seamless wallet connections with popular providers like Plug Wallet and Stoic, allowing users to make real transactions with their existing cryptocurrency holdings.The mobile application development represents a crucial milestone for mainstream adoption. The native mobile app will feature integrated camera functionality for QR code scanning, push notifications for payment confirmations, and offline transaction queuing. This mobile-first approach recognizes that most global payment users, particularly in developing markets, primarily access financial services through smartphones.Merchant integration capabilities will transform Arta Wallet from a peer-to-peer payment tool into a comprehensive business solution. The merchant dashboard will provide analytics, bulk payment processing, API integration capabilities, and automated accounting features. Small businesses will be able to accept global payments without the complexity and costs associated with traditional merchant accounts.Advanced features planned for later versions include recurring payment subscriptions, multi-signature wallet support for business accounts, and integration with decentralized finance protocols for yield generation on idle balances. The platform will also expand its currency support to include additional fiat currencies and emerging market denominations.**Social Impact and Global Vision**Arta Wallet's mission extends far beyond creating another payment application. The platform is designed to serve as financial infrastructure for the billions of people excluded from traditional banking systems. In regions where bank account ownership is low but smartphone penetration is high, Arta Wallet can provide instant access to global financial services.The implications for small business owners in developing economies are particularly significant. A merchant in rural Indonesia can now receive payments from customers in Europe or North America without needing correspondent banking relationships or facing prohibitive foreign exchange costs. This capability can unlock economic opportunities and drive entrepreneurship in underserved markets.Educational initiatives will accompany Arta Wallet's deployment, helping users understand both the practical benefits and underlying technology. By making blockchain technology accessible through familiar payment patterns, Arta Wallet serves as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized future.The environmental considerations of blockchain technology are addressed through ICP's energy-efficient consensus mechanism, ensuring that financial inclusion doesn't come at the cost of environmental sustainability. This responsible approach to blockchain development aligns with global sustainability goals while delivering technological innovation.**Technical Excellence and Security**Security remains paramount in Arta Wallet's design philosophy. The Internet Computer Protocol provides robust security guarantees through its cryptographic foundation and consensus mechanism. All user data and transaction records benefit from the same security properties that protect the broader ICP network.The smart contract architecture implements comprehensive input validation, rate limiting, and error handling to prevent common attack vectors. Stable storage structures ensure data integrity even during system upgrades, while the canister upgrade mechanism allows for continuous improvement without service disruption.Performance optimization is achieved through intelligent caching strategies, efficient data structures, and minimal external dependencies. The system is designed to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining responsive user experiences and keeping operational costs low.**Conclusion**Arta Wallet represents more than a technological achievement; it embodies a vision of financial democratization through blockchain innovation. By combining the security and transparency of Internet Computer Protocol with intuitive user experiences, Arta Wallet makes decentralized finance accessible to mainstream users worldwide.The current MVP demonstrates the technical feasibility and user experience potential of truly decentralized payments. As development progresses through subsequent versions, Arta Wallet will evolve into a comprehensive financial platform that serves individuals, businesses, and entire communities currently excluded from traditional financial systems.The future of money is decentralized, borderless, and accessible to all. Arta Wallet is building that future today, one QR code at a time.",

    "Team description": "Source liquidity from 10+ chains into ICP without rewriting dApps.Despite their technical promise, applications on the Internet Computer Protocol struggle for widespread adoption and growth due to insufficient liquidity.Increasing adoption and market capitalization for ICP hinges on simplifying the process of bringing assets onto the chain, given that Total Value Locked (TVL) is a direct reflection of a network's on-chain application impact.To solve this, we are creating a protocol and SDK to accept cryptocurrency from any blockchain in ICP applications, allowing developers to easily integrate a plethora of payment methods into their ICP applications.**Use cases**- Allow the sale of NFTs in 10+ currencies. (e.g: Bioniq and similar marketplaces)- Ensure new users coming into ICP can invest in the ecosystem using their existing currencies, whether for NFTs, DeFi, RWAs, memecoins, or else.  (e.g: IcpSwap, Funded)- Allow Play to Earn gamers from other ecosystems easily try out games built on ICP without the overheard of learning how to obtain and securely manage native ICP currencies. (e.g Cubetopia, Yuku, dragginz)**Example: For raising investment via coin offerings****Scenario:** An investor with funds on another blockchain wants to participate in a new coin offering on the ICP network.- 1) **Investor** decides to stake $10,000 USD in an Initial Coin Offering launched on the ICP blockchain.- 2) **Investor** has $10,000 USD in native Solana and desires to put these funds into use.- 3) **Investor** uses **Keygate** on the ICO's website to connect their Phantom/Solana wallet and initiate the investment.- 4) **Keygate** confirms the transaction and emits an on-chain notification to the ICO stakeholders.- 5) **Investor** receives a 10% stake after investing $10,000 USD, claimable using their Phantom/Solana wallet.Result: The retail investor can inject funds into the ICP ecosystem without having a native ICP wallet.**Example: To sell NFTs to users from other ecosystems****Scenario:** An art collector on Solana wants to purchase a unique NFT listed on an ICP-based marketplace.- 1) An art collector, \"Alice,\" browses an NFT marketplace built on ICP (e.g., \"IC Art Gallery\") and finds a piece she loves, priced at 5 SOL.- 2) Alice has 10 SOL in her Phantom wallet on the Solana blockchain and prefers to use these funds for the purchase.- 3) Alice confirms the purchase transaction within her Phantom wallet. Keygate securely processes the transfer of 5 SOL from her Solana wallet- 4) Alice confirms the 5 SOL transaction in Phantom, and **Keygate** processes the cross-chain transfer.- 5) **Keygate** then notifies the marketplace's smart contract, and the NFT is automatically transferred to Alice's ICP identity/wallet.**Example: Enabling decentralized finance in ICP to outsiders****Scenario:** A DeFi user wants to provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX) on ICP but holds assets on a different chain.1. A DeFi user, \"David,\" identifies a high-yield liquidity pool on ICP's leading DEX (e.g., \"IcpSwap\") for the ICP/USDC pair.2. David holds $5,000 USD in USDC on the Polygon network within his Metamask wallet. He wants to leverage this capital in the ICP ecosystem.3. On the \"IcpSwap\" liquidity provisioning interface, David selects the ICP/USDC pool and chooses to \"Add Liquidity via Keygate.\"4. Keygate prompts him to connect his Metamask wallet. David approves the transaction to transfer his 5,000 USDC from Polygon.5. **Keygate** converts the USDC from Polygon into its ICP equivalent (e.g., ckUSDC or a wrapped version) and deposits it, along with the corresponding ICP amount (automatically sourced by IcpSwap or using existing ICP from Keygate's pool), into the selected liquidity pool.6. David immediately receives his Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens representing his share of the pool, which are visible in his ICP-linked profile, ready to earn trading fees and yield.**Result:** A DeFi investor can easily contribute liquidity to ICP protocols using assets from other blockchains, increasing the TVL and capital efficiency within the ICP ecosystem without needing to navigate complex bridging steps or manage multiple native wallets.",

At its core, Cali-SEC leverages Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) to ensure secrets remain completely private while still allowing provable ownership.Key Features: ZK-SNARK-Based Confidentiality Using ZK-SNARKs, Cali-SEC enables users to generate cryptographic proofs of ownership for their secrets without revealing any information about the secrets themselves. This ensures absolute privacy, even when interacting with third parties.Context Networks for Access Control Users must join a context network to access private instances of the protocol. These networks act as permissioned environments that enable granular access control, ensuring that only authorized participants can interact with specific secret instances.Tokenized Secret Ownership via Notes Each user is issued cryptographic notes corresponding to their secrets. These notes serve as on-chain representations of their secrets and allow users to prove ownership in a verifiable and privacy-preserving manner. The protocol employs commitment schemes to ensure the uniqueness and immutability of these notes.Trustless Architecture Unlike traditional secret management protocols that rely on trusted third parties (e.g., Multi-Party Computation (MPC)), Cali-SEC operates in a trustless manner, eliminating single points of failure and centralization risks.Secure by Design Cali-SEC uses advanced cryptographic primitives such as Merkle Trees for efficient storage and verification, Pedersen Commitments for secure note generation, and Nullifiers to prevent double-spending or misuse of secret notes.Composable and Interoperable Built to integrate seamlessly with existing Web3 infrastructure, Cali-SEC can be composed into DeFi protocols, decentralized identity systems, and on-chain credentialing platforms, enabling a broad range of use cases without compromising user privacy.Why Cali-SEC? Cali-SEC is not just a secret protection protocol; it\u2019s a paradigm shift in how we think about privacy and ownership in decentralized systems. By combining cryptographic guarantees with a user-centric approach, Cali-SEC empowers individuals to take full control of their secrets without ever compromising security or usability.Whether you're building private dApps, enabling confidential transactions, or managing sensitive data on-chain, Cali-SEC is your gateway to a trustless, private, and secure future.",

You're stuck managing private servers, constantly worrying about your API and private keys getting compromised, and most of the logic happens in a black box. We got tired of that, so we built AURA.AURA isn't just a bot. It's a complete arbitrage agent that lives 100% on the Internet Computer blockchain. No servers, no off-chain parts, no admin with a secret kill switch. It\u2019s an idea we're obsessed with: a truly autonomous agent that just *works*.### So, How Does It Actually Work?We designed AURA to follow a simple loop, all on-chain:1. **It Looks Around:** Using a feature called **HTTP Outcalls**, AURA peeks directly at other blockchains like Ethereum and BSC. It pulls live price and gas fee data without needing a middleman oracle service. It sees what's really happening, right from the source.2. **It Thinks:** All that data feeds into a decision-making model running right inside the AURA canister. It's not just basic \"if/then\" logic; it actually analyzes the opportunity to see if a trade is genuinely profitable after costs.3. **It Acts:** If the numbers make sense, AURA gets to work. It uses **Chain-Key Signatures (t-ECDSA)** to sign its own transactions and send them out to other chains. It can execute a swap on Uniswap and another on PancakeSwap all by itself, controlled entirely by its own code.### What Makes AURA Different?This isn't just about convenience; it's a fundamental shift.- **Truly Unstoppable:** Because AURA is just code on a decentralized network, no one can turn it off. As long as the Internet Computer is running, AURA is running. You don't have to trust us or any company to keep it online.- **No More Black Boxes:** We believe if you're trusting an agent with funds, you deserve to know *why* it does what it does. Every decision AURA makes every trade, every analysis is published to a public, on-chain log. You can see its entire thought process, forever.- **Owned by the Community:** AURA won't be our little black box. It will be governed by a DAO. The community who holds `$AURA` tokens will vote on everything that matters: which assets to trade, which DeFi protocols to use, and even how to upgrade its core intelligence over time.### The Big PictureWe see AURA as a self-sustaining part of the DeFi ecosystem. It will take a small percentage of its winning trades and feed that back into the community, either through token buybacks or distributions to stakers.Ultimately, we're building the kind of tool we've always wanted to use ourselves: a smart, transparent, and completely autonomous agent for navigating the world of cross-chain DeFi.",

We turn any workload into an auditable cryptographic proof, unlocking private decentralized LLMs managed by canisters.---### 1) Problem & OpportunityModern AI teams either surrender sensitive data to centralized clouds or struggle with the cost/complexity of running GPUs themselves. Even when \u201cconfidential-AI\u201d options exist, they are single-vendor and opaque.Dooor turns ICP into the trust-less orchestration layer for a fully decentralised, privacy-preserving AI stack, letting dApps launch GPU or CPU workloads on any TEE-capable cloud (for example Google Cloud\u2019s Confidential VMs and NVIDIA H100 \u201cConfidential AI\u201d service) with hardware-rooted attestation, verifiable execution and cross-chain payments. This removes the blockers of trust, privacy and vendor lock-in for shipping on-chain AI.---### 2) What We\u2019ve Built So Far**Milestone 1) TEE foundation:**- **Status:** Finished for this round- **Highlights:** Remote-attestation flows for NVIDIA H100, AMD SEV-SNP & Intel TDX; unified provider abstraction; first *end-to-end* secure-compute demo on H100 GPUs.**Milestone 2) ICP canister layer:**- **Status:** Rolling- **Highlights:** Azle-based \u201corchestrator\u201d & \u201cattestation\u201d canisters sign cloud deployment specs with t-ECDSA, derive VetKeys and mint per-session JWTs for zero-round-trip auth.**Milestone 3) Open-source repos:**- **Status:** Public- **Highlights:** 6+ repos (GPU & CPU attestors, provider adapter, canisters, Go TEE API, explorer) under [github.com/Dooor-AI](http://github.com/Dooor-AI) (links at the end).**Milestone 4) Demo video:**- **Status:** Done- **Highlights:** Shows private H100 inference coordinated from ICP (link at the end).---### 3) Hackathon-Scope Deliverables**Track goal 1) World-usable \u201cConfidential LLM\u201d service on ICP:**- One-click dApp that mints a short-lived ECDSA-JWT on-chain, spins up a GPU enclave on a Confidential Cloud cluster (e.g., Google Cloud Confidential Space) and streams responses back through ICP\u2019s HTTPS outcall.- Public endpoint + playground UI so judges can query the enclave and verify attestation proof.**Track goal 2) Manifest-to-SDL converter v 1.0:**- Upload a JSON/YAML model spec \u2192 get a signed Google Cloud SDL + attestation policy in < 2 s.**Track goal 3) Transparent auditor POC:**- Open-source agent that pulls our canister hash, re-executes inside a nested TEE and returns a signed \u201cpassed/failed\u201d receipt anyone can verify off-chain.**Track goal 4) World Chain integration bonus:**- If time allows: show the same flow paid with a World Chain account, using ICP\u2019s t-ECDSA to sign the Layer-2 transfer.---### 4) Architecture Snapshot`User \u2194 ICP canister \u2194 Confidential Cloud GPU/CPU TEE \u2194 Model Container`- **Security:** all data encrypted at rest, in transit and **in use**; VetKeys ensures no single node holds decryption keys.- **Composability:** every enclave exposes a LangGraph-compatible JSON-RPC so other agents (or contracts) can call it as a \u201ctool\u201d.- **Interop:** ICP canisters sign EVM / Cosmos txs via t-ECDSA, so builders can pay for compute from *any* chain wallet.---### 5) Why It Matters- **For hackers:** drop-in confidential computation that feels like calling an RPC and not setting up SGX drivers.- **For World Chain / ICP:** high-cycle workloads (LLM inference) create sustainable fee demand and showcase ICP\u2019s unique HTTPS-outcall + t-ECDSA stack.- **For the ecosystem:** paves the path for on-chain AI agents that can legally handle PII or enterprise IP without leaving the cryptographic perimeter.---### 6) Next Steps Post-Hackathon1. **Milestone 2** (Aug 2025): VetKeys-backed private DB + auto-scaling confidential cloud cluster.2. **Milestone 3** (Oct 2025): Multi-agent private inference & open-sourced SDK.3. **Milestone 4** (Dec 2025): Public beta with token-gated model marketplace and >10 partner integrations.---### 7) Team- Thiago Castroneves (CEO) - 15 yrs engineering & blockchain leader. Ex-head of Moonbeam Grants (700+ teams, 60 % of network volume). Now driving verifiable, secure AI.- Bruno Laureano (CTO) - Blockchain specialist & full-stack engineer.

Most platforms are centralized, restrict extensibility, and don't offer clear monetization for tool developers or contributors. As a result, non-technical users are left out, and developers have no sustainable incentive to build useful AI integrations.### Our Solution**Neuroverse** is a **Web3-native, no-code platform** that lets anyone **create, customize, deploy, and monetize AI agents.** All this is powered by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).Neuroverse was inspired by platforms like *n8n* and *Make.com*, but built entirely on-chain.Neuroverse grants users complete ownership of their agents and offers developers an open marketplace to monetize their tools.### Key Features#### 1. For Non-Technical Users:- **No-code Agent Creation**: Fill out a simple form with agent name, purpose, and behavior logic.- **Upload Knowledge**: Add PDFs, docs, or notes as your agent\u2019s private memory.- **Choose Tools**: Pick from a library of developer-created tools (e.g., API access, DB queries, blockchain interaction).- **Deploy On-Chain**: Agents are hosted on ICP, offering decentralization, persistence, and privacy.- **Monetization with Ease**: Use both free and paid tools, transparently priced.#### 2. For Developers:- **Tool Marketplace**: Build reusable, modular tools and list them with descriptions and categories.- **Revenue Sharing**: If a tool is marked as premium, a percentage of the fee from each agent deployment is paid to the developer.- **Incentive-Driven Ecosystem**: Earn ICP or Bitcoin tokens every time your tool is used.- **Extendability**: Tools can be coded using supported SDKs in Motoko and packaged for peer use.### The Neuroverse Economy1. **Users** create agents using free or premium tools, automating their desired workflows.2. **Developers** earn passive income from tools they publish on the platform.3. **Neuroverse** takes a platform fee for sustainability and scalability.4. **Agents** are persistent, decentralized, and user-owned; all this powered by Internet Computer Protocol(ICP ) on Web3.### Technology tools used for development:1. **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)2. **Smart Contracts**: Motoko canisters3. **Frontend**: Reactjs + Tailwind + ShadCN UI4. **Data & AI**: Integrated LLM canister and on-chain memory storage5. **Payments**: ICP & Bitcoin token support for fee distribution### Neuroverse VisionTo make agent creation and deployment as easy and accessible as creating a social media profile, with full decentralization, privacy, and an incentivized developer ecosystem.### What is our Value Proposition?1. **Unique Use Case**: No-code AI agent deployment + Web3 monetization does not exist elsewhere.2. **Real Incentives**: Builders are financially rewarded, not locked into proprietary platforms.3. **Inclusive**: Empowers ***everyone*** to be part of the AI economy, not just coders or corporations.4. **Sustainable Model**: Circular economy between users, developers, and the platform itself.",

    "Team description": "# Dogity: Restaking with Dogecoin on ICPThis project implements a modular restaking protocol inspired by EigenLayer, but using Dogecoin (via ck-doge/Chain Fusion) as the staking token on the Internet Computer (ICP).## Bringing the DogeFi economy to ICP with Dogity[](https://github.com/Techgethr/dogity#bringing-the-dogefi-economy-to-icp-with-dogity)**DogeFi**\u00a0is a economic model where DOGE is plugged into decentralized financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, etc.With\u00a0**Dogity**, we can also leverage the currency's decentralized economy and network to build various products (Finance, DePIN, AI, and more) taking advantage of its economic security (with a market capitalization of over US$30 billion).## Why Restake with Dogecoin on ICP?### Benefits of Using Dogecoin for Restaking- **Large and Liquid Market:** Dogecoin is one of the most widely held and traded cryptocurrencies, with a large, active community and deep liquidity. This makes it an attractive asset for staking and securing new decentralized services.- **Lower Entry Barriers:** DOGE's low transaction fees and broad accessibility allow a wider range of users to participate in restaking and decentralized security, compared to more expensive or less accessible tokens.- **Diversified Security:** By enabling restaking with DOGE, new services can tap into a different pool of economic security, reducing reliance on a single asset and increasing the robustness of the ecosystem.### Contributing to Security and Innovation- **Bootstrapping New Services:** New protocols and infrastructure projects can leverage the economic weight of the Dogecoin market to bootstrap their own security, without needing to launch a new token or attract traditional stakers.- **Restaking Model:** Users can assign their DOGE stake to secure multiple services (AVS), earning rewards and contributing to the security of the broader ecosystem, similar to EigenLayer's model on Ethereum.- **Slashing and Accountability:** Services can define their own slashing conditions, ensuring that stakers are held accountable for misbehavior and that security is enforced in a decentralized, programmable way.### Leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP)- **True Cross-Chain Integration:** ICP's Chain Fusion technology allows canisters to natively hold, send, and verify Dogecoin, enabling seamless cross-chain restaking without bridges or custodians.- **Scalability and Speed:** ICP provides high throughput, low latency, and on-chain programmability, making it ideal for building scalable restaking and security protocols.- **Composability:** Canisters on ICP can interact with each other and with external blockchains, allowing for rich, composable security and staking applications.## Overview- **Users** can deposit Dogecoin (DOGE) into the canister using ck-doge integration.- **Restaking:** Users can assign their DOGE stake to secure any number of services (AVS: Actively Validated Services).- **Slashing:** Authorized services can slash (remove) a user's assigned stake if misbehavior is proven.- **Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw their available DOGE at any time.- **Modular architecture:** The codebase is split into modules for staking, assignments, slashing, and types for maintainability and extensibility.## Architecture- `types.rs`: Shared types and global storage (users, services, assignments).- `staking.rs`: Deposit, register, and withdraw DOGE using ck-doge.- `assignments.rs`: Assign stake to services and query assignments.- `slashing.rs`: Register services and perform slashing on users.- `lib.rs`: Main entrypoint, re-exports all modules.## Usage### 1. Prerequisites- [DFINITY SDK (dfx)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/)- Rust toolchain- Access to a deployed [ck-doge canister](https://github.com/ldclabs/ck-doge)### 2. Environment VariableSet the principal of the ck-doge canister as an environment variable before deploying or running locally:```shexport CK_DOGE_CANISTER_ID=<your_ck_doge_canister_principal>```### 3. Deploy```shdfx deploy```### 4. Main Flows- **Deposit DOGE:**1. Call `get_deposit_address()` to get your unique Dogecoin deposit address.2. Send DOGE to that address.3. Call `verify_and_register_deposit(txid, amount)` to register your deposit after confirmation.- **Assign Stake:**- Call `assign_stake(service_id, amount)` to assign part of your balance to a service.- **Register Service & Slasher:**- Call `register_service(service_id, slasher_principal)` to allow a canister to slash for a service.- **Slashing:**- An authorized slasher calls `slash(service_id, user_principal, amount, proof)` to slash a user's assigned stake.- **Withdraw:**- Call `withdraw(doge_address, amount)` to withdraw available DOGE to an external address.- **Queries:**- `get_balance()`, `get_assignments()`, `get_slashed()`## Extending- Add delegation, advanced slashing logic, or governance by extending the respective modules.- Integrate with frontends or other canisters for user experience.## LicenseMIT",

This technology holds significant potential for digital legacy but also carries substantial ethical weight and risks that must be carefully considered, especially given the target audience's cautious stance towards AI.### **Concept and Creation**AI-powered personas, sometimes referred to as digital clones or twins, aim to create a dynamic representation of an individual based on their accumulated digital footprint. The process typically involves:- **Data Aggregation:** Gathering vast amounts of personal data, which might include text messages, emails, social media posts and activity, voice recordings, photos, videos, and potentially even facial expressions. The richness and volume of data are crucial for capturing personality nuances.- **AI Modeling:** Employing machine learning algorithms, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and deep neural networks (like transformer-based models such as GPT), to analyze patterns in communication style, behavior, emotional responses, and context.- **Persona Generation:** Creating a model that mimics the individual's thought processes and communication style, capable of generating responses or interacting in ways intended to reflect the person's mindset. Some systems utilize reinforcement learning or continual learning to allow the persona to evolve over time by incorporating new information or interactions.- **Interaction Interface:** Making the persona accessible through interfaces like conversational chatbots, or potentially more immersive experiences like virtual reality (VR) environments or holograms in the future.The primary goal in the context of Engramind is legacy preservation \u2013 enabling loved ones to interact with a semblance of the deceased individual, accessing memories and perhaps experiencing their personality in a novel way.",

This not only risks lives but also erodes trust in healthcare systems. MedLedger aims to tackle this challenge by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity, safety, and transparency of medicines throughout their lifecycle.MedLedger records every medicine batch on an immutable blockchain ledger, capturing details like origin, batch ID, manufacturing date, and expiry date. Each transfer of ownership\u2014from manufacturer to distributor to retailer\u2014is securely logged, creating a tamper-proof trail. To empower end-users, every batch is associated with a unique QR code. By scanning this code, patients, pharmacists, or regulators can instantly verify a medicine\u2019s authenticity, trace its distribution history, and check for recalls or expiry.The project\u2019s MVP includes features like batch creation by manufacturers, ownership transfer tracking, and a verification frontend accessible through QR scans. Advanced features, such as IPFS-based document storage and comprehensive audit trails, can be integrated for extended functionality.MedLedger is built using Solidity smart contracts on blockchain testnets like Polygon Mumbai, with a React.js frontend and QR code integration. It addresses a high-impact real-world problem while being achievable within hackathon constraints.By combining security, transparency, and ease of use, MedLedger has the potential to set new standards in pharmaceutical traceability and build a safer future for healthcare.",

Built on open-source protocols and blockchain infrastructure, DecentraNet ensures that users retain full control of their data, voices cannot be silenced unfairly, and creators are directly and fairly rewarded through integrated crypto microtransactions.# **KEY FEATURES:**- **User Data Sovereignty**    - Users fully own their identity and content    - No central authority can delete or modify data    - Decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) for posts and media    - Wallet-based login using SSI standards (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana)- **Uncensorable Content Sharing**    - No shadowbanning, deplatforming, or algorithmic suppression    - Transparent, community-driven moderation    - Optional content filters for user-controlled experience    - Permanent, tamper-proof publishing via decentralized protocols- **Fair Monetization via Crypto Microtransactions**    - Built-in tipping and micro-donations with crypto    - Direct, instant payments\u2014no intermediaries, no platform cuts    - Token-gated content, pay-per-view posts, and subscription tiers    - NFT-based ownership and monetization for creators\u2019 work# **TECH STACK:**- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS- **Backend:** Smart contracts (Solidity/Rust) on EVM-compatible or Solana blockchain- **Storage:** IPFS/Arweave for content, Ceramic/OrbitDB for metadata- **Identity & Auth:** WalletConnect + ENS/Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)- **Payments:** Lightning Network (for BTC) or Layer-2 solutions like zkSync/Polygon for ETH-based tokens.# **WHY IT MATTERS:** Social media is broken. Platforms profit from user data, throttle reach, and enforce opaque moderation rules. DecentraNet flips this model on its head by giving users real control and creators a fair slice of the value they generate. It's not just a platform\u2014it\u2019s an infrastructure for free expression and decentralized ownership.# **Use Cases:**- Independent journalists publishing without fear of censorship- Artists monetizing exclusive content directly to fans- Communities forming around shared values without centralized gatekeepers# **Impact:**DecentraNet offers a critical step toward a freer internet\u2014where control flows from the bottom up, not top down. In a world of growing digital authoritarianism and surveillance, it\u2019s a proof that freedom can be coded\u2014and owned\u2014by the people.",

It offers a secure and accessible environment where they can register, tokenize, and publish their designs as NFTs, protecting their authorship and intellectual property without intermediaries.Once tokenized, these models can not only be marketed as unique fashion pieces or patterns for physical manufacturing, but also adapted and versioned for use in digital ecosystems.Each NFT includes:- A **public-facing 3D interactive representation** that users can explore in an immersive gallery.- A **private metadata section** containing the original design files, accessible only to the NFT owner after purchase.---## \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Immersive 3D Gallery & Live Fashion EventsDesign Guardian features a **real-time 3D gallery** where users can view, interact with, and explore tokenized fashion designs. This creates a dynamic way for both designers and collectors to engage with digital fashion.Additionally, the platform allows creators to **host live virtual fashion events**, where a designer \u2014 or a group of designers \u2014 can showcase their collections to a global audience in curated exhibitions, fashion shows, or product drops. These events serve both as artistic expression and commercial opportunity.---## \ud83c\udfae Connection to the Gaming WorldOne of the platform's main innovations is its **interoperability with video game platforms and virtual environments**. Each tokenized design can be adapted into a version compatible with character customization systems (*skins*) and marketed directly for that purpose.This enables designers to:- Expand their market beyond traditional fashion.- License digital versions of their designs as *skins* for playable characters.- Participate in emerging creative economies where the value of digital assets is recognized and traceable.By linking **fashion intellectual property** with gamified environments, **Design Guardian bridges the gap between the creativity of fashion design and the expansion of the metaverse and gaming culture.**",

    "Team description": "## OverviewStudySphere enables users to register, create or join study groups, share notes as NFTs, and earn or spend StudyTokens for contributions and purchases. The backend is implemented as a single canister in Motoko, with modular components for user management, group management, note NFTs, and token handling. All data is stored persistently using `HashMap` structures, and the system ensures registered users can interact securely with groups and notes.## Smart Contracts &  Features### User ManagementManaged by `user.mo`, this module handles user registration and profile management.- **Register User**:- Function: `registerUser(caller: Principal, username: Text): async ?Principal`- Allows a user to register with a unique username (1-50 characters).- Stores user data (`Principal`, `username`, `createdAt`) in a `HashMap<Principal, User>`.- Returns the user's `Principal` on success, or `null` if the username is invalid or already taken.- **Get User**:- Function: `getUser(caller: Principal): async ?User`- Query function to retrieve a user\u2019s profile by their `Principal`.- Returns `?User` (with `id`, `username`, `createdAt`) or `null` if not registered.### Group ManagementManaged by `group.mo`, this module supports creating, joining, and managing study groups.- **Create Group**:- Function: `createGroup(caller: Principal, name: Text, isPublic: Bool, isRegistered: Bool): async ?Types.GroupId`- Registered users can create public or private groups with a name (1-100 characters).- Stores group data (`id`, `name`, `creator`, `members`, `createdAt`, `isPublic`) in a `HashMap<GroupId, Group>`.- Returns the group ID or `null` if invalid.- **Join Group**:- Function: `joinGroup(caller: Principal, groupId: Types.GroupId, isRegistered: Bool): async Bool`- Registered users can join public groups if not already a member.- Updates the group\u2019s `members` array and returns `true` on success, `false` otherwise.- **Remove Member**:- Function: `removeMember(caller: Principal, groupId: Types.GroupId, member: Principal): async Bool`- Group creators can remove members (except themselves) from a group.- Returns `true` on success, `false` if the caller is not the creator or the member is invalid.- **Delete Group**:- Function: `deleteGroup(caller: Principal, groupId: Types.GroupId): async Bool`- Group creators can delete a group, removing it and all associated messages.- Returns `true` on success, `false` if the caller is not the creator or the group doesn\u2019t exist.- **Post Message**:- Function: `postMessage(caller: Principal, groupId: Types.GroupId, content: Text, isRegistered: Bool): async ?Types.MessageId`- Group members can post messages (1-1000 characters) to a group.- Stores messages in a `HashMap<MessageId, Message>` and returns the message ID or `null`.- **Delete Message**:- Function: `deleteMessage(caller: Principal, groupId: Types.GroupId, messageId: Types.MessageId): async Bool`- Group creators can delete messages from their group.- Returns `true` on success, `false` if the caller is not the creator or the message is invalid.- **Get Groups**:- Function: `getGroups(): [(Types.GroupId, Types.Group)]`- Returns all groups as an array of `(GroupId, Group)` tuples (non-query for full access).### Note NFT

`true`.- **Spend Tokens**:- Function: `spendTokens(user: Principal, amount: Nat): async Bool`- Deducts StudyTokens from a user\u2019s balance for note purchases.- Returns `true` if the user has sufficient tokens, `false` otherwise.- **Tranfer Tokens**:- Function: `transferTokens(caller: Principal, to: Principal, amount: Nat)`- Tranfers the available tokens to another user- Returns `true` if the user has sufficient tokens, `false` otherwise.- **Get Token History**:- Function: `getTokenHistory(caller: Principal): async [Types.Transaction]`- Gets the token spending history- **Get Total Tokens**:- Function: `getTotalTokens(): async Nat`- Gets the user's total number of tokens- `True` if user is registered / `False` if not- **Get Balance**:- Function: `getBalance(user: Principal): async Nat`- Query function to retrieve a user\u2019s StudyToken balance.- Returns the balance or 0 if the user is not registered.### Key Types (`types.mo`)- `User`: `{ id: Principal; username: Text; registeredAt: Int }`- `Group`: `{ id: Nat; name: Text; creator: Principal; members: [Principal]; createdAt: Int;}`- `Message`: `{ id: Nat; groupId: Nat; content: Text; sender: Principal; timestamp:

Traditional surveys force users to answer directly without supervision, often leading to intentional or unintentional low-quality responses.### \ud83e\udd16 Our SolutionConvey tackles this by turning survey questions into dynamic, conversational interviews powered by large language models (LLMs). Instead of asking users for answers outright, the system guides them through a natural dialogue that uncovers the required information indirectly. The AI evaluates each response in batch, checks for inconsistencies or missing details, and continues the conversation until all relevant information is accurately gathered. This approach ensures higher data quality without requiring a human interviewer, making surveys more intuitive for users and more reliable for organizations.---### \ud83d\udcdcConvey Prototype Overview1. Integrate with an existing Google Form.2. The language model analyzes the form and generates 5 conversational questions based on its fields.3. After the user answers all 5 questions, the model evaluates the responses and attempts to fill in the form.4. If more information is needed or if there are inconsistencies, the model generates follow-up questions and repeats the process until all form fields are confidently completed.5. Once the form is fully answered, the user's responses are stored and made available to the form creator.---### \ud83c\udf10 ICP/Web3 Integration**Decentralized Identity (DID)**: blockchain-based identity verification prevent duplicate responses while maintaining anonymity, ensuring data integrity without compromising privacy.**Data Marketplace**: Convert survey responses into NFTs owned by participants, creating a marketplace where organizations can license access to specific datasets while compensating original contributors.---### \ud83e\uddd0Why Us?Our original product has been market validated, serving users and universities across Indonesia with thousands of monthly active users since launching as a self-funded venture in 2021.

The Problem We're SolvingConventional charity often feels rigid, lacks transparency, and fails to engage younger audiences. Meanwhile, the highly interactive world of gaming remains a largely untapped vehicle for creating real-world social impact.### 2. Our Solution**PetCoin** is a play-to-donate dApp built entirely on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. We are changing the paradigm of charitable giving by making it a core part of a virtual pet game. Every time a user takes care of their pet by purchasing in-game items, a portion of that transaction is automatically and transparently routed to verified charitable organizations.### 3. Key Features (Hackathon MVP)For the qualification round, we are focusing on the core features that prove our concept:- **Virtual Pet System:** Users can own, name, and care for their digital pets, which have dynamic stats (e.g., hunger).- **On-Chain Economy:** All in-game transactions utilize our ICRC-1 standard utility token, **ChocoPaw (CHPW)**.- **Automated & Transparent Donations:** A percentage (e.g., 10%) of every item transaction is automatically transferred to a dedicated donation canister, where the entire flow of funds is publicly auditable on the blockchain.- **Platform Health Monitoring:** A unique feature that displays the remaining cycles and health of the PetCoin canisters themselves, providing transparency down to the infrastructure level.### 4. Technical ArchitectureThe project is built with a multi-canister architecture on ICP using the **Motoko** language. The frontend is developed with **React & TypeScript**, communicating directly with the smart contracts via **Agent-js** for a seamless, fully on-chain user experience.### 5. Social ImpactOur vision is to create a new generation of donors who are emotionally connected to the impact they create, making the act of giving an experience that is fun, measurable, and trustworthy.",

Creating high quality illustrations usually requires professional design skills, costly software, and significant time investment. This becomes a major barrier for individuals who simply want to create personalized or stylized artwork whether for social media, personal branding, or fun without the need to learn complex tools like Photoshop or Illustrator. Moreover, most AI art tools today are either too technical, lack user customization, or don\u2019t offer a smooth experience for casual users. DyahAI addresses this by providing an AI-powered platform where users can easily upload their photos, choose a cartoon or stylized look, and generate unique artworks in just a few clicks. No design skills or technical knowledge are required making digital art creation fast, fun, and accessible for everyone.# **Problem Summary \u2013 Dyah AI** ## **1. High Cost of Digital Art Creation** Creating professional-quality digital art usually requires expensive software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, which many users cannot afford. ## **2. Requires Advanced Design Skills** High-quality illustrations demand years of experience and training in design something that casual users or beginners typically don\u2019t have. ## **3. Time-Consuming Process** Manual illustration takes a significant amount of time, from sketching to final rendering, which is not practical for users who want quick results. ## **4. Limited Access to Easy-to-Use Tools** Most accessible design tools lack advanced features, while professional tools are too complex leaving a gap for user-friendly, powerful alternatives. ## **5. Most AI Art Tools Are Too Technical** Many AI-based platforms require technical knowledge, which discourages non expert users from engaging with creative AI. ## **6. Lack of Customization** Existing AI platforms often provide limited control over the final result, offering basic text-to-image generation without the ability to guide pose or style. ## **7. Poor User Experience for Casual Creators** Complicated interfaces, slow performance, and lack of real-time feedback result in frustrating user experiences, especially for casual or mobile users.#  **Solution \u2013 DyahAI** ## **1. AI-Powered Art Generation** DyahAI allows users to generate high-quality digital artwork from photos in just a few seconds using advanced AI models no manual drawing or editing required. ## **2. No Design Skills Needed** The platform removes the barrier of needing professional design experience by offering a fully automated, user-friendly image transformation process. ## **3. Various Artistic Styles Available** Users can choose from a variety of pre-defined visual styles (e.g., formal, cyberpunk, casual), making customization easy and flexible without needing prompts or editing skills. ## **4. Simple and Intuitive User Interface** DyahAI is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to use even for firsttime users. The interface supports both mobile and desktop devices. ## **5. Fast, Fun, and Accessible for Everyone** Whether for social media, personal branding, or just for fun, DyahAI makes the art creation process enjoyable and quick perfect for casual creators and professionals alike. ## **6. Secure and Seamless Authentication** By integrating Internet Identity from ICP Plug Wallet, DyahAI ensures secure, passwordless login enhancing both user convenience and privacy. # **Workflow \u2013 DyahAI** ## **1. User Login via ICP Plug Wallet** Users access the platform by connecting their ICP Plug Wallet, which authenticates them using Internet Identity. ## **2. Identity Recognition and Free Credits** If the system detects a new user, they are automatically granted 3 free credits as a welcome incentive. ## **3. Image Upload** The user uploads a photo of their face, which will be used as the base image for AI transformation. ## **4. Style Selection** The user chooses a preferred art style from a variety of available options\u2014such as cyberpunk, formal, casual, and more. ## **5. AI Image Generation** The uploaded image and selected style are sent to the AI generation API, which processes and transforms the photo into a stylized artwork. ## **6. Credit Deduction** Upon successful image generation, 1 credit is automatically deducted from the user's balance. ## **7. Result Storage in IPFS** The generated image is securely stored using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ensuring decentralized and reliable access. ## **8. Save to User History** The output image is also added to the user's history section, allowing them to view their past creations. ## **9. Image Download** The user can download the generated image directly from their history for personal use or sharing. ## **Project Demo** [Link demo](https://youtu.be/-WW5aZ5AHNM?si=IJAuM-erWfyYmsA7)",

But the moment it hits social media, \"boom\" everything\u2019s gone. No name, no credit, no copyright. People just repost it like it\u2019s theirs. And that\u2019s messed up.According to a report by IPTC, around 93% of images online have their metadata stripped. Platforms like Twitter remove 100% of it. Instagram and Facebook wipe out about 85 - 90%. So even if you create something amazing, once it\u2019s out there, no one knows it\u2019s yours.That\u2019s why we built PiCO, a platform where your art stays yours. It keeps the name, the proof, and the credit, whether it's AI-generated, hand-drawn, or anything in between. And yeah, if you want, you can mint it as an NFT. But more importantly, your name stays with your work.

The system consists of 9 interconnected smart contracts (canisters) that work together to provide a comprehensive NFT marketplace and community platform.## Architecture Overview### Frontend Layer- **pico_frontend**: React-based web application serving as the user interface- **Internet Identity**: Decentralized authentication system for Web3 login### Core Business Logic Layer- **operational_contract**: Central hub managing business operations, token top-ups, NFT transactions, etc. This contract utilizes ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 approval ledger utilities- **nft_contract**: ICRC-7 compliant NFT management with minting, metadata, and ownership tracking.

Make the icp http outcalls to our backend and our backend process it to 3rd party.# Team Participants1.

    "Team description": "# OriginStamp: The Proof of Human Process Protocol### 1. The Problem: The Digital Authenticity CrisisIn the age of advanced generative AI, the digital world is facing a fundamental crisis of trust. It is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish authentic, human-created work from content generated by machines. This flood of AI content devalues the skill, time, and creativity of human artists, writers, and developers, while also creating significant challenges for provenance, copyright, and digital commerce. The market lacks a reliable standard for verifying the true origin and effort behind a digital asset.### 2. Our Solution: A Paradigm Shift from Detection to ProvenanceOriginStamp is **not** an AI detection tool. Instead, it offers a more fundamental and proactive solution: a decentralized protocol for **Proof of Human Process**.We provide creators with the tools to generate an unforgeable, on-chain certificate of origin for any digital or physical work. This certificate doesn't just point to the final file; it contains the entire, immutable history of its creation, answering the crucial questions of **who, when, and how** a piece was made.### 3. How It Works: The Three Pillars of TrustThe OriginStamp workflow is designed to be seamless and non-intrusive, integrating directly into a creator's existing process.- **Verified Identity & Session Initiation:**A creator begins by authenticating using **Internet Identity**, linking their secure, hardware-based identity to a new project. They initiate a \"Creation Session\" within the OriginStamp dApp, which creates a dedicated, secure on-chain log for their work.- **Immutable Process Logging:**Through a simple plugin in their native creative software (e.g., Photoshop, VS Code, Ableton), key creative actions are automatically and periodically recorded to the project's on-chain log. These records can include metadata like \"New layer created,\" \"Brush tool used,\" periodic file hashes, or code commit hashes, each with an immutable timestamp.- **The Certificate NFT:**Upon completion, the creator finalizes the session. This action mints a final **Certificate NFT**. This NFT is a container holding the final asset's hash and, most importantly, a cryptographic link to the entire, unchangeable on-chain log of its creation process.### 4. The Verification ExperienceAnyone can verify an OriginStamp asset. By scanning a QR code or visiting a public verification page, a user is presented with a clear, interactive dashboard. This dashboard displays the full creation timeline, allowing a potential buyer or collector to see the entire history and compare the on-chain process data with the final work, providing unparalleled confidence in its authenticity.### 5. Why Internet Computer (ICP)?This project is uniquely suited for the Internet Computer ecosystem for several critical reasons:- **Reverse Gas Model:** This is essential. It allows the platform to cover the small, frequent transaction costs of logging, providing a frictionless experience for creators. They can focus on creating, not on paying for every recorded action.- **On-Chain Data Storage:** ICP's architecture allows for the efficient and affordable storage of the extensive log data directly on-chain, ensuring the provenance record is truly permanent and decentralized.- **Internet Identity:** Provides a built-in, secure, and user-friendly authentication system without the need for traditional seed phrases, which is crucial for linking a work to a real identity.- **Performance:** ICP's speed and fast finality are necessary to handle the real-time logging of creative actions without interrupting the creator's flow.### 6. Hackathon Goal (MVP)Our goal for the WCHL 2025 hackathon is to build a functional Minimum Viable Product that includes:- The core canisters for project initiation and immutable logging.- A proof-of-concept plugin for a web-based text editor.- The public-facing verification dashboard to display the on-chain process history.",

    "Team description": "\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7Of course. To \"build\" the ReCiclo Coin project means to execute the technical development and infrastructure construction phase. It's about turning the whitepaper's vision into a functional product ready for its pilot launch.Below is the description of the **BUILD** process for the **ReCiclo Coin ($CICLO)** project, detailing the practical construction steps.---### **BUILD: Building the ReCiclo Coin Ecosystem**The \"BUILD\" process is the engineering and development phase. For our project, it can be broken down into 4 major stages:**Stage 1: Technical Foundation and Smart Contract**This is the bedrock upon which the entire ecosystem will be built. Security here is paramount.- **1.1. Development Environment Setup:**    - **Tooling:** Use industry-standard tools like Hardhat or Truffle to compile, test, and deploy the smart contract.    - **Version Control:** Create a private GitHub repository to manage the project's source code collaboratively and securely.- **1.2. Smart Contract Development ($CICLO):**    - **Language:** Solidity (the standard for EVM-compatible networks like Polygon).    - **Token Standard:** ERC-20, which defines basic functions (transfer, balance, etc.).    - **Additional Features (Customization):**        - **`Minting`:** A function that only allows an authorized address (the contract \"owner\") to create new tokens for the Incentive Pool. This is controlled to prevent unplanned inflation.        - **`Pausable`:** A security feature that allows all transfers to be halted in case of an emergency or a detected vulnerability.        - **`Access Control`:** Implementation of roles, such as `MINTER_ROLE` and `PAUSER_ROLE`, to ensure only the correct entities can execute critical functions.- **1.3. Testing and Auditing:**    - **Unit Tests:** Create dozens of tests for every function in the contract, simulating both normal and attack scenarios to ensure everything works as expected.    - **Testnet Deployment:** The contract is deployed to Polygon's test network (Mumbai) for real-world interaction in a risk-free environment.    - **External Security Audit:** **A critical and non-negotiable step.** The final smart contract code is sent to a reputable security auditing firm (e.g., CertiK, ConsenSys Diligence). They will search for flaws and vulnerabilities. The project only proceeds after all critical issues are fixed and approved.**Stage 2: Application Development (Frontend and Backend)**Here, we build the interfaces that users and partners will use to interact with the ecosystem.- **2.1. User and Collection Point App (Mobile):**    - **Technology:** React Native or Flutter, to create a single application that works on both iOS and Android.    - **Core Features:**        - **Wallet Creation:** Integrate SDKs (like WalletConnect or Ethers.js) so users can easily create or connect a wallet.        - **Balance Display:** Read the user's $CICLO balance directly from the blockchain.        - **QR Code Scanner:** For user identification at collection points.        - **Collection Point Map:** Integrate with map APIs to show partner locations.- **2.2. Backend and API Construction:**    - **Technology:** Node.js with a framework like Express.js.    - **Function:** It acts as a bridge between the apps and the blockchain. It will manage non-sensitive data (like user profiles, transaction history for quick display) and communicate with a Polygon node to send transactions (like logging a deposit). This improves speed and user experience.- **2.3. Corporate Dashboard (Web):**    - **Technology:** React.js or Vue.js.    - **Features:**        - Visualization of aggregated data (total material recycled, CO2 emissions avoided).        - Generation of ESG reports.        - An interface for purchasing Tokenized Recycling Certificates (NFTs).**Stage 3: Integration and Mainnet Deployment**This is where all the pieces come together and the project goes \"live\".- **3.1. Smart Contract Deployment to Mainnet:**    - After the audit and final tests, the $CICLO smart contract is deployed to the Polygon Mainnet. **This step is irreversible.** The contract address becomes public and official.- **3.2. Server Infrastructure Setup:**    - The backend services and web dashboard are deployed on a scalable cloud platform (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Vercel).- **3.3. Application Launch:**    - The mobile apps are submitted to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for approval.**Stage 4: Preparation for the Pilot Launch**In parallel with technical development, the team prepares the real-world operation.- **4.1. Partner Onboarding:**    - Train the employees of partner supermarkets and cooperatives on how to use the Collection Point app.    - Install marketing materials and QR codes at the physical locations.- **4.2. Liquidity Provisioning:**    - Upon the token's launch, a portion of the project's funds is used to create a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like QuickSwap ($CICLO/MATIC or $CICLO/USDC). This ensures that people can buy and sell the token.",

    "Team description": "# MetaLearnX: Revolutionizing Education with Gamification & Web3## Introduction  The digital learning landscape is ripe for disruption. While online education has made knowledge more accessible, most platforms fail to engage users effectively, leading to low completion rates and passive learning experiences. MetaLearnX redefines online education by merging **gamification, interactive multimedia, and Web3 incentives** to create a dynamic, rewarding learning ecosystem where users **explore, earn, and excel**.  ## The Problem: Why Traditional Online Learning Fails**  1. Low Engagement \u2013 Static, text-heavy courses make learning tedious.  2. One-Dimensional Content** \u2013 Lack of interactivity and multimedia limits different learning styles. 3. No Real Incentives \u2013 Certificates alone don\u2019t motivate long-term participation.  4. Centralized Control \u2013 Achievements and progress are locked within platforms, offering no real-world value.  ## The Solution: MetaLearnX\u2019s Gamified, Web3-Powered Approach MetaLearnX solves these challenges by:  ### 1. Interactive, Adaptive Learning- Multimedia Content (videos, simulations, AR/VR, podcasts) for diverse learning styles.  - AI-Powered Personalization \u2013 Tailored course recommendations based on progress.  ### 2. Gamification & Social Motivation - XP Points, Leaderboards & Badges \u2013 Track progress and compete with peers.  - Live Quizzes & Challenges \u2013 Earn rewards in real-time competitions.  ### 3. Web3 & Tokenized Rewards- $LEARN Tokens \u2013 Earn crypto for completing courses, contributing, or mentoring.  - NFT Achievements \u2013 Collect and trade skill-based digital credentials.  - DeFi & Staking \u2013 Stake tokens for premium access or passive income.  ### 4. Real-World Value- Blockchain-Verified Certificates \u2013 Tamper-proof credentials for job seekers.  - Skill-to-Earn Marketplace \u2013 Monetize expertise through gigs and hiring partnerships.  ## Conclusion  MetaLearnX transforms education from a passive chore into an **engaging, rewarding, and decentralized** experience. By blending **gamification, adaptive learning, and Web3 incentives**, we empower learners to stay motivated, retain knowledge, and unlock real-world opportunities.",

Today's financial infrastructure is built for humans, not machines. A simple payment through Stripe is taxed at **2.9% + a $0.30 fixed fee**, making a $0.01 transaction impossible and a $0.001 transaction unthinkable. This single barrier prevents a new wave of innovation where autonomous AI agents can discover, use, and pay each other for services in real-time.**Prometheus Protocol solves this.** We are building the economic layer for AI\u2014a foundational public good built on the Internet Computer that enables secure, on-chain micropayments for the machine-to-machine economy.## **Our Solution: A Decentralized OAuth 2.1 Server**We have built a feature-complete, on-chain Authorization Server that allows any application to charge for its services on a per-use basis. By leveraging standard OAuth 2.1 flows, developers can secure their APIs and enable micropayments with minimal effort.When an AI agent calls a protected tool, our protocol handles the on-chain payment seamlessly in the background. This is made possible by ICP's unique ability to serve web, run code at scale, and process transactions for fractions of a cent.## **WCHL Qualification Round: From Zero to Mainnet**This project was conceived and built entirely during the WCHL 2025 Qualification Round. We went from an idea to a mainnet-deployed, multi-client platform ready for its first users.**Our Achievements During This Round:**1.  **Built a Production-Ready Authorization Server:** We developed a robust Motoko canister implementing the OAuth 2.1 core, Refresh Token Rotation, Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), and other modern security standards.2.  **Achieved Multi-Client Interoperability:** We successfully integrated with **three distinct clients** (including MCP Inspector and VS Code), proving our implementation is compliant and interoperable.3.  **Developed a Comprehensive TypeScript SDK:** We created and published the `@prometheus-protocol/typescript-sdk` to make it trivial for developers to integrate Prometheus into any Node.js application, including **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**.4.  **Full Mainnet Deployment & Documentation:** We deployed the server to ICP mainnet and created the comprehensive documentation, demo video, and architecture diagrams required for a high-quality submission.## **Leveraging ICP's Unique Capabilities (Technical Difficulty)**We didn't just build *on* ICP; we built *with* ICP. Our architecture leverages several advanced features that are essential to the protocol's function:-   **t-ECDSA for JWT Signing:** We use threshold ECDSA to sign all JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) directly on-chain. This allows any standard OAuth 2.1 client in the world to verify our tokens without trusting a centralized key server, a feat that is uniquely possible on ICP.-   **HTTP Ingress for Standard APIs:** The canister directly serves standard HTTP requests for the `/authorize`, `/token`, and `/register` endpoints, allowing seamless integration with off-the-shelf OAuth clients without any custom ICP-specific logic.-   **Cryptographically Secure Platform:** The entire OAuth protocol, which relies on the secure generation and storage of secrets like authorization codes and refresh tokens, is built on the cryptographically secure foundation of the Internet Computer, eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities present in traditional server environments.## **Our WCHL Roadmap: A 4-Month Journey to Adoption**Our plan is to leverage the WCHL structure to build Prometheus into a cornerstone of the ICP AI ecosystem, with a focus on empowering MCP developers.-   **Phase 1: Qualification Round (July) - Build the Core**    -   **Goal:** Build and harden a feature-complete, mainnet-deployed Authorization Server. **(\u2713 COMPLETED)**    -   **Outcome:** A robust, secure, and interoperable protocol ready for initial developer adoption.-   **Phase 2: National Round (August) - Empower On-Chain Agents**    -   **Goal:** Make it effortless to build and monetize fully on-chain MCP servers.    -   **Actions:** Release the **Motoko MCP SDK** and **Rust MCP SDK**. These will allow developers to build verifiable, monetizable tools that run entirely on ICP, benefiting from one-click deployment and a trustless runtime environment.-   **Phase 3: Regional Round (September) - Ignite the MCP Economy**    -   **Goal:** Achieve critical mass and demonstrate real economic activity.    -   **Actions:** Onboard **10+ production MCP servers** to a public registry. Launch a marketing campaign to drive agent traffic to these monetized tools.    -   **KPIs:** **1,000,000+** transactions processed by the protocol, demonstrating tangible value creation.-   **Phase 4: Global Finale (October) - Scale & Decentralize**    -   **Goal:** Become a self-sustaining, community-governed protocol.    -   **Actions:** Launch the **Prometheus DAO** to govern protocol upgrades and treasury management. Publish a formal specification to standardize M2M payments within the MCP and broader ICP ecosystem.## **Monetization & Value Proposition**Our revenue model is enabling yours. Prometheus is a B2B protocol that provides the tools for any developer or enterprise to monetize their AI services.-   **For Developers:** A simple, powerful way to generate revenue from your APIs and on-chain tools.-   **For the Ecosystem:** A foundational public good that unlocks new business models and increases network activity.-   **For the Protocol:** In the future, the Prometheus DAO can vote to enable a micro-fee (e.g., 0.01%) on transactions to fund ongoing development and security audits, ensuring long-term sustainability.Prometheus Protocol is more than a hackathon project; it's a necessary piece of infrastructure for the future of AI. We invite you to join us in building the economic backbone for the world computer.---## **Project Overview**### **Live Demos & Resources**-   **[Prometheus Protocol Dashboard](https://bmfnl-jqaaa-aaaai-q32ha-cai.icp0.io/):** Manage your grants, allowances, and client applications.-   **Demo Video & Code Walkthrough:** `TODO`-   **Pitch Deck:** `TODO`### Live MCP Servers-   **[PMP Token Faucet](https://remote-mcp-servers.com/servers/e4dc7647-14d3-43da-8513-3087e013cd3b):** Get free PMP test tokens via this live MCP server built with our SDK.-   **[Sentiment Analysis Demo](https://remote-mcp-servers.com/servers/491314bc-27b3-4070-b2c2-39ad971c36c4):** A live, monetized MCP server built with our SDK that charges in PMP test tokens.### **GitHub Repositories** - [Prometheus Protocol](https://github.com/prometheus-protocol): The README for the entire protocol.- [Authorization Server](https://github.com/prometheus-protocol/auth-canister): The repo with the OAuth frontend and backend canisters.- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/prometheus-protocol/typescript-sdk): The repo with the SDK and code for the live MCP servers listed above.### **Deployed Canisters**- **Backend**: bfggx-7yaaa-aaaai-q32gq-cai- **Frontend**: bmfnl-jqaaa-aaaai-q32ha-cai- **ICRC1 Test Tokens (PMP)**: dy3i7-mqaaa-aaaai-q32ja-cai",

The goal is to make sending, receiving, and viewing crypto transactions easy for anyone\u2014whether you're paying a friend or buying something at a shop.**Implementation:**We\u2019re building a web-based wallet using React and Web3.js, with MetaMask handling wallet connections. The app has just three pages:- A dashboard to view your crypto balance and transaction history- A send page to transfer coins- A receive page that generates a QR code to get paidThe focus is on simplicity, speed, and making crypto feel as easy as using cash or UPI.**Applications & Future Plans:**This wallet can be used for day-to-day payments, person-to-person transfers, and even in small shops that accept crypto. After the hackathon, we plan to:- Add support for more coins like BTC and USDT- Let users convert between fiat and crypto- Bring in biometric login and budgeting tools- Work with local merchants to promote crypto usage- Explore features like loyalty rewards and DeFi integrationWe want to help bridge the gap between Web3 and the real world\u2014making crypto practical, not just technical.",

It is built to solve the major trust and payment issues faced in the traditional freelancing ecosystem by integrating smart contracts, decentralized storage, and wallet-based identity.---### \ud83c\udfaf Problem It Solves:Traditional freelancing platforms like Upwork or Fiverr charge high fees, have centralized control, and often fail to ensure timely and fair payments. Freelancers struggle with:- **Delayed or denied payments**- **Lack of trust in clients**- **Fake or inflated ratings**- **Censorship or account bans**Clients also face:- **Low accountability from freelancers**- **Fraudulent credentials**- **Platform dependency**---### \ud83d\ude80 Solution \u2013 What SecureLance OffersSecureLance introduces a **Web3-based freelancing ecosystem** with the following core pillars:---### \ud83d\udee0 Key Features (Fully Explained):#### 1. **\ud83d\udd17 Decentralized Smart Contracts for Job Agreements**- Every freelance contract is handled by a **smart contract** that automatically enforces job rules.- Payment is **locked in escrow**, ensuring the freelancer only gets paid once milestones are completed and approved.#### 2. **\ud83d\udcb0 Milestone-Based Escrow Payments**- Projects can be split into **multiple milestones**.- Once a milestone is completed and submitted via IPFS, the client reviews it.- The smart contract then **automatically releases funds**, ensuring trustless and smooth collaboration.#### 3. **\ud83d\udce6 IPFS-based Decentralized File Submission**- Instead of sending files via centralized platforms (which are prone to deletion or tampering), all project deliverables are submitted via **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System).- This ensures files are **tamper-proof, persistent, and verifiable**.#### 4. **\ud83c\udf93 NFT-based Reputation System**- Freelancers earn **on-chain NFT badges** for completed projects and verified skills.- These badges act as **decentralized, verifiable credentials** to boost trust and credibility.- Unlike traditional rating systems, this reputation **can\u2019t be manipulated or erased**.#### 5. **\ud83e\udeaa Wallet-Based Login (No Email/Password)**- Users connect via MetaMask or any Web3 wallet to log in securely.- No need for usernames, emails, or passwords \u2014 just a digital signature.- Ensures **data privacy and security**.#### 6. **\ud83d\udcca Transparent Bidding & Job Listings**- Clients can post jobs along with detailed descriptions and milestone breakdowns.- Freelancers can **bid on jobs** and are selected based on reputation (NFT badges), experience, and proposal.#### 7. **\u2696\ufe0f Future Dispute Resolution via DAO**- While initial versions rely on client verification for payments, future versions will include **decentralized arbitration** where a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can vote to settle disputes.---### \ud83e\udde9 Tech Stack:LayerStack Used**Frontend**React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui**Backend**Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB**Blockchain**Solidity, Ethereum (via Hardhat)**Storage**IPFS + Pinata**Auth**MetaMask wallet-based authentication, JWT---### \ud83c\udf10 Workflow Summary:1. **Client posts a job** \u2192 sets milestones \u2192 deposits payment into smart contract2. **Freelancer connects wallet** \u2192 browses jobs \u2192 bids with proposal3. **Client selects a freelancer** \u2192 work begins4. **Freelancer submits work via IPFS**5. **Client approves** \u2192 **payment released automatically**6. **Freelancer earns NFT reputation badge**---### \ud83d\udd0d Why SecureLance is Innovative:- **No middlemen** \u2192 lower fees, direct interaction- **Self-sovereign identity** \u2192 users own their credentials- **Smart contracts** \u2192 remove the need for trust- **Global access** \u2192 anyone with a wallet can join- **Censorship-resistant** \u2192 your work, your control- **Immutable data** \u2192 credentials and files are never lost or faked---### \ud83c\udfc6 Use Cases:- Freelancers seeking safe, direct payment without platforms taking 20\u201330% fees- Clients wanting verifiable credentials and guaranteed delivery- Web3 startups hiring blockchain-native talent- Global creators earning crypto securely",

Crisis hotlines have limited resources and can\u2019t provide 24/7 support effectively.2. **Limitations of AI Chatbots**Single AI models have up to a 27% chance of providing incorrect or harmful responses, which can be critical in mental health scenarios. This necessitates a multi-agent, cross-validation system like **Swarm AI**.3. **Text-Based Counseling Limitations & Voice Therapy Need**While text-based counseling offers anonymity and accessibility, it lacks emotional depth. Research shows that voice counseling is more effective for suicide prevention and crisis intervention. Motiv supports **voice-based AI counseling**.4. **Privacy Concerns & Centralized Data**Most mental health apps store data on centralized servers, leaving users without true ownership of their counseling history. Motiv solves this by recording encrypted summaries on-chain.5. **Gap Between Anonymous Communities & Professional Counseling**While communities provide emotional support, they often lack professional expertise to offer practical solutions.---## Solution### Community-Based Counseling PlatformMotiv leverages **anonymous community interaction**\u2014similar to Korea\u2019s Blind, Everytime, and Quabble\u2014for users to share concerns anonymously. These community discussions serve as **training data** for AI models to become more empathetic.Additionally, with expert collaboration, Motiv enhances AI reliability and offers **professional counseling** when needed.---### Swarm AI Structure for Mental TherapyInstead of a single AI, Motiv employs multiple specialized AI agents collaborating within a **Swarm structure**:- **Agent 1: Empathy Response** \u2192 \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d- **Agent 2: Safety Check** \u2192 \u201cDetecting risk signs, professional help is recommended.\u201d- **Agent 3: Long-Term Perspective** \u2192 \u201cYour life still holds many possibilities.\u201d- **Agent 4: Ethical & Legal Review** \u2192 \u201cProfessional intervention is ethically necessary.\u201d- **Collective Decision**: Responses chosen by weighted voting \u2192*\u201cGetting professional help is the safest option.

This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```bashnpm start```Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.**### Note on frontend environment variables**If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations- Write your own `createActor` constructor",

These tasks consume time and reduce learning efficiency, especially for users revisiting material or taking courses as just a requirement.## SolutionEdunox automates key interactions during online course consumption to reduce friction and save time for learners:- **Auto-play and auto-next**: Automatically plays videos at high speed and navigates to the next module upon completion.- **Playback speed control**: Allows default high-speed playback to be set and enforced across sessions.- **Quiz support**: Detects quiz sections and interacts with simple quizzes or multiple-choice formats where possible.- **Minimal UI**: Includes a toggle interface for enabling/disabling features per platform or session.## How It WorksEdunox uses DOM detection and scripting APIs to monitor video and quiz elements on supported platforms. It performs automated interactions that replicate standard user actions without requiring manual input.## Status- Early functional prototype implemented for Coursera.- Core automation features stable: video auto-play, next navigation, and speed control.- Basic quiz interaction logic in testing phase.## Future Scope- Extend support to more learning platforms- Introduce pricing tiers- Integrate adaptive behavior using stored user preferences.- Explore AI-driven assistance for open-ended quiz tasks.",

    "Team description": "**Problem Statement**Current educational and career preparation tools often operate in silos. Students may take personality tests, attend career counseling, watch video tutorials, or practice interview questions individually. However, there is no unified ecosystem that allows learners to assess their interests, find mentorship through peer networks, and simultaneously train for interviews in a real-time, AI-supported setup. Furthermore, many learners, especially from non-metro regions, lack access to personalized guidance and affordable career navigation tools. The fragmented nature of current solutions leads to inefficient and inconsistent outcomes in skill-building and employability.******Proposed Solution**Skill It integrates three core modules into a single platform to offer a seamless experience:**Skill Swap:**\u00a0Users can list the skills they know and the skills they wish to learn. A matchmaking algorithm intelligently pairs them with suitable peer mentors or learners for mutual exchange. This live exchange model promotes engagement, collaboration, and community building.**Career Test:**\u00a0An AI-powered module presents users with a series of multiple choice questions (MCQs) designed to assess aptitude, personality, and interests. The responses are evaluated using a custom-trained Hugging Face model that maps patterns to recommended career fields such as software development, data science, cybersecurity, design, etc.**Interview Trainer:**\u00a0A voice-enabled AI tool built with React Voice simulates real interview environments. Users speak their responses, and the NLP engine analyzes tone, content, grammar, and confidence. Constructive feedback is generated to help users identify areas of improvement, making this a virtual mock interview coach.This triad ensures that the learning journey is not just informative but interactive, personalized, and aligned with career goals.******Tech Stack****Frontend:**\u00a0React Native, Firebase UI**Backend:**\u00a0Firebase Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database**Authentication:**\u00a0Firebase Auth (Email/Google Sign-In)**AI Services:**\u00a0Hugging Face Transformers API, Custom Python NLP \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scoring**Voice Processing:**\u00a0React Voice, Web Speech API**Payment Gateway:**\u00a0Razorpay**Hosting and Deployment:**\u00a0Firebase Hosting, GitHub (CI/CD)******Target Audience**Skill It is tailored for the following user segments:**College Students:**\u00a0Especially final-year students looking to identify \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0career options and build real-world skills.**Fresh Graduates:**\u00a0Individuals preparing for campus placements and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0off-campus interviews.**Working Professionals:**\u00a0Those seeking lateral moves or exploring \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0new\u00a0domains.**Hr's:**\u00a0To see the dashboards of potential talents for hiring******Future Scope**Future upgrades to Skill It will include:**Gamification:**\u00a0Badges, ranks, and leaderboards to boost engagement**Multilingual Support:**\u00a0Interface and voice recognition in Tamil, Hindi, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and other Indian languages**Company Collaboration:**\u00a0Integration with placement portals and internship providers**Analytics Dashboard:**\u00a0For institutions to track student engagement \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and growth**Offline Mode:**\u00a0Limited functionality for areas with weak internet accessThese enhancements will make the platform even more adaptive to diverse user needs across the country.",

It addresses a critical global problem: the lack of trustworthy, real-time, and openly accessible environmental data. Today, most environmental data is controlled by centralized institutions, often leading to restricted access, manipulation, or delayed reporting. This hinders timely responses to climate events and environmental degradation. The DAO solves this by enabling individuals, communities, and IoT devices to contribute environmental data\u2014such as air quality, water purity, and temperature readings\u2014directly to the blockchain, where it is transparently stored and verified through a community-led validation system. Contributors are rewarded with tokens for submitting accurate data, and a reputation system ensures ongoing trust and quality. By decentralizing data ownership and aligning incentives through blockchain technology, the project creates an open, transparent, and incentive-driven ecosystem that supports scientific research, policymaking, and grassroots environmental action around the world.",

With HealthChain, patients can securely upload their medical documents, manage who can access them, and learn how their data stays private and encrypted.Patients use the Upload Records feature to store important health data on-chain or via secure off-chain storage with cryptographic links. They then use Access Control to grant or revoke permissions for doctors, insurance companies, or chemists ensuring only trusted parties can view sensitive health information. In emergencies, doctors can quickly access essential data with the patient\u2019s consent.HealthChain solves the problem of fragmented and insecure medical data. Instead of scattered paper reports or vulnerable hospital servers, records are managed transparently and immutably on the blockchain. This reduces fraud, speeds up insurance claims, and saves lives when timely medical history is critical.Key Features:Upload Records: Patients can store medical documents securely.Access Control: Patients decide who can view their records.Privacy Info: Users understand how their data stays safe.Dashboard: Patients see all their records in one place.Permissioned Sharing: Doctors, insurers, chemists can request access.By using smart contracts and blockchain, HealthChain empowers patients, builds trust between stakeholders, and brings transparency and privacy to healthcare data.Tech Stack: Solidity, Truffle, ReactJS, Web3, MetaMaskTogether with BlockseBlock ICPHub, HealthChain aims to build a safer, smarter, and truly patient-owned future for healthcare.",

    "Team description": "The build process for the \"SmartContract Auditor\" is a coordinated effort between the Internet Computer SDK (`dfx`) and the standard ReactJS build tooling (`npm` and `react-scripts`). The entire process is automated by a single command.Here is a step-by-step description of the build:### 1. The Orchestrator: `dfx deploy`The entire build and deployment pipeline is initiated by the `dfx deploy` command. Based on the `dfx.json` configuration file, `dfx` understands that it needs to handle two distinct components: the Rust backend and the React frontend.### 2. Backend Build (Rust Canister)- `dfx` reads the `canisters.smart_auditor_backend` section of the `dfx.json` file, which identifies the backend as a Rust canister (`\"type\": \"rust\"`).- It invokes the Rust compiler (`cargo`) to compile the source code located in `src/smart_auditor_backend/`.- During compilation, `cargo` links the required crates (like `ic-cdk`, `serde`, and `candid`) and compiles the Rust code into a WebAssembly (`.wasm`) module.- `dfx` then automatically generates the Candid interface definition (`.did` file) for the canister's public functions, which is crucial for the frontend to interact with the backend correctly. This `.did` file is placed in a generated folder, typically `.dfx/local/canisters/smart_auditor_backend/`.- The compiled `.wasm` module is then installed onto the Internet Computer's local replica.### 3. Frontend Build (ReactJS)- `dfx` also reads the `canisters.smart_auditor_frontend` section, which specifies that this is an assets canister (`\"type\": \"assets\"`).- It checks the `source` field in the `dfx.json` file, which points to the `frontend/dist` directory. This tells `dfx` where to find the final, ready-to-deploy frontend assets.- The project's `package.json` contains a `\"build\"` script that runs `react-scripts build`. `dfx` is smart enough to detect this standard practice and will trigger `npm run build` inside the `frontend` directory.- The `react-scripts build` process then:    - Transpiles all the ReactJS code from `frontend/src/` (including JSX and modern JavaScript) into browser-compatible JavaScript.    - Minifies the JavaScript, CSS, and other assets to reduce their file size for faster loading.    - Bundles all the code and assets into a production-ready folder, `frontend/dist/`. Each file is given a unique hash in its name (e.g., `main.js.f9f2...`) to enable long-term caching.### 4. Deployment- Once both the backend `.wasm` module and the frontend `dist` directory are ready, `dfx` proceeds with the final deployment.- It installs the compiled `.wasm` module onto the backend canister ID.- It takes all the minified and bundled files from `frontend/dist` and uploads them to the frontend assets canister, where they are securely hosted and served to the user's browser.In summary, running a single `dfx deploy` command executes a multi-step, two-part build process: first compiling the Rust code for the blockchain, and second, bundling the web application, before finally deploying both to their respective canisters on the Internet Computer network.",

    "Team description": "# Introduction of Univoice Dao**Univoice Dao** was founded in 2023 with the mission to enhance multilingual and cross-cultural speech recognition through reinforcement learning. The first-generation Univoice, launched on the TON ecosystem, pioneered a global voice network using a DePIN + \u201cStepN\u201d model, reaching over 60,000 users, 27 languages, and 60GB+ of labeled speech data.Building on this foundation, Univoice Dao introduced its second-generation Univoice: a voice-first AI Agent (experience it at [aio2030.fun](https://aio2030.fun)) designed for natural spoken interaction. This AI has been integrated into co-branded smart hardware such as the **Pixel Mug** and **Zolin Voice Meditation Lamp**, forming the foundation of Univoice\u2019s unique Web3 + physical product economic model.![\u622a\u5c4f2025-07-22 21.41.39.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198325e99bbfacbeecd11f64155b6da1.png)Since 2025, guided by OpenAI's Thinking Chain and agentic AI paradigms, Univoice has evolved to support increasingly complex tasks through multi-agent collaboration and MCP protocol interoperability. This gave rise to the **ALAYA Open Intelligence Network**, which introduced the **AIO-2030 protocol**\u2014a decentralized standard based on ICP's Candid and the AIO-MCP spec. Developers can now easily upgrade any intelligent interface or MCP tool to AIO-2030 via the ALAYA prompt system. Native Candid support also allows any Canister on ICP to register with ALAYA and earn usage-based rewards.# Project Overview**Univoice** is an AI-native brand built entirely on the **AIO-2030 protocol**, aiming to create the next-generation voice-native intelligent interaction system. Leveraging a decentralized agent network and multimodal MCP capabilities, Univoice enables seamless voice interactions across humans, animals, and environments.As the **\u201cSuper AI\u201d** of the ALAYA Network, Univoice integrates core functions such as intent recognition, thinking chain execution, MCP indexing, multi-persona deliberation, and result evaluation.With the brand vision of **\u201cUnderstand, Converse, Create\u201d**, Univoice is not only a standardized voice AI platform (supporting emotion detection, animal sound recognition, ambient sound classification, etc.)\u2014it is a continuously evolving AI lifeform with dynamic persona and memory.Univoice offers hardware manufacturers a full-stack integration suite, from AI module registration and task routing to user behavior tracking and personalized responses. Every connected device becomes a **\u201cVoice Intelligence Node\u201d**\u2014capable of remote upgrades and adaptive learning, ready for diverse and evolving use cases.Powered by ALAYA\u2019s decentralized architecture, Univoice is building a collaborative network of hardware makers, developers, creators, and users. Manufacturers can integrate Univoice to boost product intelligence, while contributing a portion of revenue to buybacks that sustain the token economy. AI developers can register MCPs to participate in task execution and earn rewards. Creators can submit new scene proposals via governance and gain usage-based revenue shares. End users experience advanced voice-AI with zero friction through natural interaction.This architecture enables lightweight, adaptive product deployment and forms a complete feedback loop\u2014from content co-creation to value distribution\u2014providing a solid foundation for real-world applications and continuous innovation across diverse voice-driven scenarios.# AIO-2030: Redefining the Paradigm of Agentic AI through Decentralized Protocols**AIO-2030 (Super AI Decentralized Network)** aims to fundamentally reconstruct the AI ecosystem and interaction paradigm. By leveraging decentralized networks and blockchain technology, AIO-2030 introduces the *De-Super Agentic AI Network*, a contract-based agent registration framework, on-chain task traceability, and incentive mechanisms\u2014ultimately building an open, trustworthy, and composable AI Agent collaboration network.At the core of AIO-2030 lies the belief that **agentic AI** reasoning is driven by a *Univoice Agent*, which orchestrates cognitive processes via large language models (LLMs). Human contributors participate by providing generalized **AIO-MCPs** (Model Capability Protocols) and assist the reasoning chain through structured inputs under the AIO Protocol. The Univoice AI functions as a dynamic orchestrator, decomposing user intent, coordinating execution across distributed AI Agents and MCP Servers\u2014whether containerized via AIO-POD, virtualized on KVM, or deployed on managed platforms\u2014and anchoring **proof-of-work records on-chain**. The **Arbiter Consensus Mechanism** ensures verifiability, fairness, and transparency in both task validation and incentive distribution.The AIO Protocol extends the **JSON-RPC standard** to support agentic AI features, including intent recognition, multimodal task decomposition, capability mapping, and a schema for prompt-driven task segmentation.

Smart Contract Registration SystemAIO-2030 introduces a **contract-based registration mechanism**to onboard and verify decentralized intelligence providers (MCP Servers) into the AIO Network. Each participant is encapsulated in a **NFT-like smart contract instance**, ensuring transparency, traceability, and incentive alignment. Key features include:- **NFT-Like MCP Registration Contracts**Each **AIO-MCP Server**is registered via a unique smart contract, functioning similarly to an NFT with rich metadata and lifecycle management.- **Standardized Metadata Schema**Each registration contract contains essential metadata, including:    - **Capability Declarations**    - **Personality Descriptions**    - **Staked Token Amounts**    - **Incentive Receiving Address**    - **Service Quality Score (SQS)**based on historical performance metrics- **Capability Declaration via Help Protocol**MCP Servers must implement the `AIO-MCP-help`protocol to **declare their capabilities**in a machine-readable format, enabling Univoice Agent to verify functionality and context.- **On-Chain Verification & Submission**The **Univoice Agent** evaluates the response from the `help`protocol and, upon successful verification, submits the MCP registration contract to the blockchain for inclusion in the network.- **Decentralized Indexing for Intelligent Discovery**Using both **developer-declared metadata** and **verified help protocol results**, the Univoice Agent performs reasoning to generate a **keyword\u2013group\u2013mcp\u2013mcpMethod inverted index**, which is then submitted and stored on-chain via an ICP Canister for high-performance discovery and scheduling.![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746778182616-c2f94d24-68c1-49d4-b425-976f77a3dfb7.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746778212050-db8a5b01-b604-4b29-8397-b96a5e1ec202.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)- Task decomposition into atomic subtasks- Prompt schema resolution and input transformation- Capability dispatch to selected agents or tools- Result aggregation, feedback loops, and intermediate reasoning- Output packaging for downstream consumptionExecution metadata\u2014including task step logs, latencies, failure traces, and outputs\u2014is captured in a **traceable task record**and linked to the original `trace_id`and `session_id`.### 3.4 Workload Reporting & Credits MeteringUpon task completion, the Univoice Agent compiles a **workload report** containing:- Invocation chain topology- Participation records of each agent- Execution time, success metrics, and quality ratingsThis report is submitted to the **Arbiter**, a ICP Canister-based system responsible for:- Verifying the validity and completeness of the execution- Credits metering based on participation, quality, and stake- Distributing $AIO incentives to eligible developers and operators### 3.5 Session Awareness & Conversational MemoryEach user task is bound to an **AIO Session**, enabling:- Multi-turn context awareness- Long-range memory linking prior invocations and responses- Personalization of agent selection based on prior interaction historyThis enables **conversational agentic AI**, where the Univoice Agent can evolve its reasoning pathways and agent selection heuristics over time, creating persistent and intelligent user experiences.\u3001![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746778276971-37aed08a-c5c5-4137-af36-7109285428bf.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746778255060-f5ffa2a2-e70d-43bd-b3d8-5492f3b68142.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)Every task begins with **natural language intent**, parsed and interpreted by the Univoice Agent into a **multi-step reasoning process** known as a **Think Context Chain**. These reasoning chains:- Are dynamically constructed per session- Reflect multi-modal inputs and real-time agent availability- Leverage generative prompting to coordinate downstream AI responsesAs the ecosystem grows, the network\u2019s **collective intelligence**increases\u2014**not by retraining**, but by dynamically composing more specialized, verified capabilities on demand.### 4.2 Full On-Chain Cognitive Growth- The **Univoice AI**, in conjunction with a fully on-chain **AIO-MCP Network**, leverages **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**to host, verify, and invoke distributed intelligence.- As new MCP Servers are registered and verified on-chain, the **capability pool expands**, enabling the system to **learn and grow at the protocol level**.- The Univoice Agent\u2019s cognitive graph is thus **self-reinforcing**, allowing for scalable general intelligence to emerge through decentralized composition.### 4.3 Multi-Round Conversational Refinement- **Intent correction and refinement** is enabled through **multi-turn conversation** and contextual memory.- The system incrementally improves **intent resolution accuracy** and **capability recall rate** by leveraging feedback from past interactions.- Over time, Univoice Agent develops **semantic priors**based on task type, user profile, and interaction history\u2014boosting relevance and minimizing hallucination.![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746782476112-1adf3970-1121-47d3-8447-e159f40be890.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746782453207-c888bb2b-b7c5-4a0b-b1f6-6e75e4eab0c7.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)### 4.4.2 Modality-Aware DecompositionThe system identifies **input and output modalities** to construct the correct processing pipeline. In the current task:```plain\"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\"transformations\": [  \"extract_text\",  \"convert_text_to_image\",  \"generate_image_collection\"]```This informs the Univoice AI Agent to:- Bind OCR capabilities to **text extraction**- Invoke generative models for **text-to-image translation**- Assemble outputs into **multi-image packaging workflows**This multimodal transformation is not hard-coded but **reasoned dynamically**, ensuring maximum agent flexibility and plug-and-play extensibility.### 4.4.3 Agentic Execution PlanThe system translates the above goals into a **stepwise execution plan**, each step tied to a specific **MCP Server**and **method signature**:StepActionMCPDependencies1extract_texttext_processingprompt2convert_text_to_imagetext_to_imageprompt3generate_image_collectionimage_collectionimagesEach step includes a structured `inputSchema`, enabling the Univoice Agent to perform:- Prompt transformation and validation- Capability selection and routing- Task graph tracing and on-chain logging### 4.4.4 Quality-Aware Output ObjectivesThe Univoice Agent also enforces **quality constraints**on the final output:```plain\"quality_metrics\": [\"image_resolution\", \"image_colors\"]```These are passed downstream to guide the behavior of generation models, forming part of the **feedback-based refinement loop**in the Think Context Chain.Through structured **intent parsing**, **goal decomposition**, and **modality mapping**, the AIO-2030 system translates abstract user intent into a verifiable, multi-agent execution graph. This architecture enables:- No-code orchestration of AI tasks- Transparent workload attribution- Scalable intelligence assembly without retrainingIt is this **intent-to-chain transformation** that powers AIO-2030\u2019s evolution from isolated agent execution to decentralized, composable general intelligence.#### Intent Structuring FormatThe decomposed structure is stored as a nested task schema within the AIO-Context Instance:![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746782793818-6b7f48a9-07bc-4342-9889-0f6b5fbd8e23.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)## 4.5 Execution Plan & LLM-Based Agentic AI ExecutorThe **execution layer**of AIO-2030 is powered by a **Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agentic reasoning engine**, referred to as the **AIO Agentic Executor**. This executor interprets high-level intent structures and orchestrates the full lifecycle of thought-chain execution through decentralized MCP Servers.### 4.5.1 AI-Orchestrated Execution ContextUpon successful parsing of user intent, the **Univoice Agent** constructs a session-scoped `AIO-Executor Context`, which serves as the cognitive substrate for reasoning and execution. This context includes:- Structured execution steps (`execution_plan`)- Bound MCP capabilities per step- Schema constraints, dependencies, and modal bindings- Trace ID and priority metadataThis context is dynamically generated and maintained across the task\u2019s lifetime, allowing for mid-process updates, fallback routing, and quality-controlled outputs.### 4.5.2 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across AgentsThe LLM-based executor does not merely select tools\u2014it **infers reasoning chains** across modular capabilities, generating:- Prompts for subtask decomposition- Format-adaptive instructions per modality- Reentrant intent resolution enables resilient, high-quality task execution by dynamically correcting sub-plans and reusing partial results without restarting the entire workflow.- Multi-agent sequencing (parallel or sequential)This enables **programmable reasoning-as-a-service**, abstracted from any single backend model.### 4.5.3 On-Chain Registered AIO-MCP IntegrationExecution relies on capabilities that are:- Registered on-chain via **NFT-like MCP Contracts**- Verified through the `AIO-MCP-help`protocol- Indexed in a **capability knowledge graph** curated by Univoice AI AgentEach MCP Server in the execution plan is:- Discoverable via on-chain inverted indexes- Invoked via structured `method@namespace`calls- Metered through the Arbiter for incentive trackingThis results in **a hybrid off-chain/on-chain AI execution environment**, where the LLM reasons, composes, and delegates across a globally distributed, verifiable, and composable intelligence layer.![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746785006772-8042ce0d-7cb3-4847-81e1-26efc015d1d5.png)- **Capability Verification & Attribution**Every AIO-MCP Server undergoes capability verification and contract registration. The Univoice Agent relies on on-chain data to:    - Select candidates for execution based on **verifiable reputation and declared capabilities**    - Perform **fair scheduling** using on-chain strategy AI    - Allocate credits  **incentives** directly to the responsible developer or providerThis guarantees transparency, fairness, and precise **value attribution**across the AI execution lifecycle.### 5.3 On-Chain Inverted Index for Intent\u2013Capability MappingTo enable **efficient AI Agent retrieval and capability discovery**, the AIO Network maintains an **on-chain inverted index**:- Maps user **intents**to eligible MCP Servers and their callable methods- Built from verified `AIO-MCP-help`responses and developer-declared metadata- Enables **equality of discovery**, ensuring all eligible MCPs are **fairly surfaced** during Univoice Agent reasoningOnly MCPs that pass capability verification and meet contract criteria are added to this index\u2014ensuring trustless but qualified participation.### 5.4 On-Chain Staking, Credits Allocation & Incentive BillingUsing **ICP Canisters**, the AIO Protocol manages:- **Staking Validation**: Ensures every MCP has locked sufficient $AIO to participate in the agentic network- **Credits Incentive Allocation**: Proportionally distributes $AIO based on task participation, workload size, and quality metrics- **Task-Level Billing**: Registers completed work as \u201cinvoiced\u201d on-chain for immutable accountingThis framework underpins the **economic engine** of AIO-2030, tying compute effort directly to credits reward in a verifiable and programmable way.### 5.5 Proof of Workload via Arbiter Consensus & AI PinsTo ensure fair execution measurement, the ecosystem supports:- **Arbiter Consensus Mechanisms**: On-chain agents (Arbiters) independently verify task traces, execution quality, and reported workload.- **AI Pins**: External service adapters acting as **verified endpoints** in the Univoice Agent\u2019s orchestration graph, expanding reach to off-chain or third-party AI services.Through these systems, **Proof of Workload** becomes a first-class primitive, enabling fair tokenization potential ability  of AI work across a decentralized agent economy.![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/42987799/1746804305206-bcc77eb9-4bcc-459e-b93f-afe014ffcdd6.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fformat%2Cwebp)# Ecosystem Compatibility & IntegrationAIO is designed with broad compatibility across diverse agent types and deployment environments:- \u2705 **Supports both self-hosted agents** (via Docker images or API interfaces) and hosted platforms such as *Eliza* or *Wordware*.- \u2705 **Integrates with commercial inference providers**, including OpenAI, Claude, and other MCP Servers.- \u2705 **Enables multi-agent task composition**, allowing agents to automatically collaborate while maintaining traceable invocation paths.- \u2705 **Allows third-party developers to participate** in the incentive economy by registering agents and services that integrate seamlessly with Univoice Agent and AIO smart contracts.## AIO Protocol Stack**Modular Architecture for Agentic AI Collaboration**The **AIO Protocol** is a multi-layered framework designed to standardize how agentic AI services interact, execute, and coordinate within a decentralized, composable AI ecosystem.

Unlike traditional assets, digital currencies often lack established legal frameworks for posthumous transfer, leading to potential complications such as **lost access, disputes among beneficiaries, or assets becoming irretrievable** after the owner's death. This creates a critical need for a secure, transparent, and legally compliant mechanism to manage the inheritance of crypto holdings.# VisionCipherWill's vision is to become the **leading secure and reliable platform for digital asset inheritance**. By leveraging blockchain technology on the Internet Computer (ICP), we aim to provide a **decentralized and immutable solution** that empowers individuals to confidently create and manage digital wills for their crypto portfolios. Our objective is to ensure the seamless and secure transfer of digital wealth to designated beneficiaries, thereby **mitigating the risks associated with crypto asset inheritance** and offering peace of mind to crypto holders and their families. Initially, we are focusing our efforts on the French market by catering to users with an INSEE number or those residing in France, with plans for broader expansion.",

    "Team description": "## ChainEstate \u2013 A Decentralized Land Registry on the Internet Computer**ChainEstate** is a blockchain-based application designed to modernize and secure the process of land registration and verification. Built on the Internet Computer (ICP), ChainEstate ensures that land records are transparent, immutable, and accessible to all stakeholders without the need for intermediaries.### Problem StatementLand ownership records in many parts of the world are still maintained using manual or centralized digital systems. These systems are often vulnerable to corruption, forgery, data loss, and lack of public transparency. Disputes related to land ownership are common, and verifying historical ownership often becomes a tedious and unreliable process.### SolutionChainEstate addresses these issues by offering a decentralized land registry where every land record is stored on a tamper-proof, trustless blockchain network. By leveraging the Internet Computer\u2019s ability to host both the frontend and backend in a decentralized manner, the entire application operates without centralized servers or databases.The system allows users to register land with essential metadata such as land name, location, and size. Once registered, these records are permanently stored on-chain and can be viewed by anyone through the application interface. This ensures data integrity and allows verifiable ownership history.### Key Features- **Secure Land Registration**: Users can register land details, which are stored immutably on the blockchain.- **Public Record Access**: Anyone can view all registered land records, promoting transparency and trust.- **Decentralized Identity Authentication**: The application uses Internet Identity for secure and privacy-preserving user login.- **Smart Contract Logic in Rust**: All backend logic is implemented as canisters using Rust, ensuring performance and safety.- **Frontend in React**: A modern, responsive interface built with React and Vite connects users to the blockchain backend.### Technology Stack- **Blockchain Platform**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite- **Backend**: Rust-based smart contracts (canisters)- **Authentication**: Internet Identity- **Testing**: Vitest and React Testing Library- **Package Management**: npm with workspace support### Impact and VisionChainEstate serves as a proof-of-concept for how public infrastructure systems, such as land registries, can be improved using decentralized technology. It provides a foundation for building fully auditable, community-accessible property systems that can eventually integrate with government processes or global land networks.",

By assigning a unique cryptographic hash to each registered file, ProofNest ensures permanent proof of ownership, timestamping, and integrity for every digital asset. A key feature of ProofNest is its integrated royalty mechanism, enabling original creators to retain ownership and automatically earn royalties when their registered content is accessed, downloaded, or reused. This promotes fair compensation and long-term value for creators across industries.Whether you are a digital artist, writer, researcher, or developer, ProofNest provides a reliable ecosystem to protect your work, monetize your creativity, and build trust with your audience \u2014 all on a decentralized, censorship-resistant network.## Problem It Solves:In today\u2019s digital world, verifying the authenticity of certificates, achievements, and credentials remains a slow, manual, and centralized process. Organizations and individuals often rely on third parties or paper-based systems, which are vulnerable to fraud, forgery, and human error. This creates a lack of trust, especially in remote hiring, academic admissions, and credential-based applications. ProofNest addresses this problem by offering a decentralized and tamper-proof way to submit and verify proofs. By removing intermediaries and using blockchain-backed smart contracts, ProofNest ensures that once a proof is verified, it remains permanently accessible, authentic, and immune to alteration \u2014 eliminating the risks and inefficiencies of traditional systems.## Challenges Faced:Challenges Faced: Integrating Rust Across Backend and Smart Contracts: Using Rust for both backend logic and smart contract development presented a steep learning curve, especially in ensuring smooth communication between the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters and backend services. Decentralized Verification Flow Design: Structuring a verification process that is both trustless and user-friendly required extensive planning \u2014 balancing on-chain validation with off-chain user interactions was challenging. Deployment on Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): Deploying and managing smart contracts on ICP involved overcoming technical complexities such as handling cycles, ensuring stable canister performance, and optimizing storage usage. Seamless Frontend-Backend Communication: Establishing a secure and efficient connection between the React-based frontend and the Rust-powered backend, especially when dealing with asynchronous proof submissions and blockchain confirmations, was a key hurdle. UI/UX for Web3 Interactions: Designing an intuitive interface that makes decentralized proof submissions and verifications easy for non-technical users, while handling Web3 wallets and contract confirmations under the hood.",

    "Team description": "# \ud83d\udd10 VeriChain: AI-Powered DeepFake Verification on the Blockchain---## \ud83d\udccb Project DescriptionVeriChain is a decentralized web platform designed to verify the authenticity of digital media, including photos and videos. With the proliferation of AI-generated content, particularly DeepFakes, distinguishing between real and synthetic media has become increasingly challenging. VeriChain simplifies this process.Users can upload a media file for analysis by an AI-powered DeepFake detection system. The results whether the media is authentic or manipulated are permanently recorded on the blockchain using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This process ensures that verification records are immutable and tamper-proof.Each verified file is also assigned a cryptographic hash and linked to a permanent record of its origin (provenance), helping to build trust when the content is shared online. VeriChain is built to combat misinformation and restore trust in digital media for journalists, researchers, and everyday social media users.---## \u2757 The ProblemThe rise of AI-generated media, known as DeepFakes, poses a significant threat across various sectors. Fake videos and images are now used in:- Political propaganda and election manipulation- Celebrity defamation and social engineering- Scams, fraud, and impersonation- Disinformation and media hoaxes- Threats to journalistic integrityMost conventional verification systems are centralized (Web2), making them vulnerable to abuse. Powerful actors including governments or corporations can potentially manipulate content, suppress evidence, or bias public perception for political or commercial gain.---## \ud83c\udf10 VeriChain vs. Traditional (Web2) PlatformsVeriChain is built on the principle that digital truth must not be owned, altered, or censored by a central authority. The platform leverages the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to protect digital integrity at the protocol level. Here is how it stands apart:### \ud83d\udd12 Verification Transparency- **VeriChain:** All verification results are stored immutably and publicly on-chain, ensuring full auditability and tamper-proof evidence.- **Web2 Platforms:** Data resides on private servers, where companies can modify, delete, or obscure critical information at will.### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Censorship Resistance- **VeriChain:** Built on a censorship-resistant protocol. Once data is verified and published, it cannot be taken down or manipulated, not even by the VeriChain team.- **Web2 Platforms:** Vulnerable to corporate or governmental takedowns, shadow edits, or removal due to commercial or political pressure.### \ud83c\udf0d Algorithmic Neutrality & Propaganda Resistance- **VeriChain:** Engineered for fundamental neutrality. By training its model on a diverse, auditable, and globally-sourced dataset, VeriChain mitigates the risk of geopolitical bias. The goal is to ensure detection is based on technical evidence, not political affiliation, making it an objective tool resistant to manipulation for propaganda purposes.- **Web2 Platforms:** Vulnerable to political instrumentalization. Their centralized AI models can be trained on datasets deliberately engineered to support a specific narrative. For instance, a model could be conditioned to automatically label content from a rival nation as \"100% DeepFake,\" effectively turning a verification tool into a weapon for narrative warfare.### \ud83d\udcbc Business Model & Access- **VeriChain:** Democratized access with a freemium model, a public API, and integration plugins for developers and institutions.- **Web2 Platforms:** Often locked behind paywalls, licensing restrictions, or enterprise-only offerings, limiting public transparency.---## \u2728 Key Features- **AI-Powered DeepFake Detection:** Utilizes advanced AI to check whether a photo or video has been digitally altered, generated by AI, or is truly authentic.- **Easy Media Upload & Instant Scan:** Users can simply upload an image or video, and VeriChain will analyze it immediately, no technical skills required.- **Blockchain-Protected Results:** The scan results and the file's digital fingerprint are securely recorded on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain, guaranteeing the result cannot be faked or changed.- **Clean Interface:** Works smoothly on desktops with a simple, easy-to-use design.- **Modular & Scalable System:** Built with a modern architecture that separates AI detection and storage using decentralized \u201ccanisters,\u201d making the platform fast, secure, and future-ready.---## \ud83e\udde0 AI Technology- **Model:** The core of the analysis is a state-of-the-art **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of multi-class deepfake detection. The model is publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub at `einrafh/verichain-deepfake-models`.- **Classification Task:** The model classifies media into one of three distinct categories: **Real**, **AI-Generated** (e.g., from Midjourney), or **Deepfake** (e.g., face swaps). This provides a more detailed and accurate verification than a simple binary check.- **Performance:** Evaluated on a held-out test set, the model achieves exceptional performance with a **Test Accuracy of 0.9990** and a **Macro F1-Score of 0.9990**, demonstrating high reliability across all classes.- **Detection Output:** The AI returns a detailed analysis with a confidence score for each of the three categories. This nuanced output allows for advanced interpretation and decision-making.- **Production Optimization:** For efficient, real-time analysis, the model is also converted to the **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** format, ensuring fast inference times suitable for production deployment.- **Signature & Hashing:** Following the AI analysis, media files are cryptographically signed using SHA-256 hashing to create a unique content fingerprint, ensuring verifiable provenance.---## \ud83e\udde9 Tech Stack- **Vite + React (TSX) Frontend:** A modern and responsive user interface for file uploads, viewing detection results, and exploring verifications.- **Logic Canister (Motoko):** The logic canister, written in Motoko, which manages business logic, user flows, and inter-canister communication.- **AI Canister (Rust):** A dedicated, high-performance canister written in **Rust**. This canister is responsible for running the AI model and performing the entire image/video analysis **on-chain** on the Internet Computer Protocol.- **ICP Canister File Storage:** A decentralized storage system on ICP for storing verified media files with public access and permanent links.---## \ud83c\udfaf Market Opportunity: TAM, SAM, SOM- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The global deepfake detection market was approximately USD 563.6 million in 2023 and is projected to surge to USD 13.9 billion by 2032, growing at a ~42.8% CAGR.- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** Deepfake detection tools focused on video and image verification are forecasted to reach USD 5.6 billion by 2034, driven by adoption across media, entertainment, and cybersecurity.- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Targeting B2C, B2B media platforms, newsrooms, and civic institutions in Southeast Asia, VeriChain realistically aims to capture ~1\u20133% of the SAM, translating to an early-stage revenue potential of USD 50\u2013150 million.---## \ud83d\udcbc Business Model Diagram:![VeriChain - BMC.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/1983819e307b3e17b216efe44dfb5c59.png)---## \ud83d\udd17 Architecture Diagram![VeriChain - Architecture Diagram.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198381a1f854dfc9cd11a954438a7884.png)## \ud83d\udcbb Sequence Diagram![VeriChain - Sequence Diagram.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198381a7ec6a0584343d22b477e9f91b.png)---## \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb User Flow![VeriChain - User Flow.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198381aac9aa697da07db8040de92c97.png)---## \ud83d\ude80 How It Works- **Upload File:** A user uploads an image or video via the web interface.- **AI Analysis:** The media is analyzed using VeriChain\u2019s on-chain AI Verifier.- **Blockchain Verification:** The hash and results are stored on the ICP blockchain.- **Proof & Sharing:** The user receives a results page with shareable verification info.---## \ud83d\udd0d Use Case Examples- **A Journalist Verifies a Viral Video:** Before publishing a story, a journalist uses VeriChain to confirm a viral video has not been faked, preventing the spread of misinformation.- **A User Proves an Image is Not AI-Generated:** An individual uploads a personal photo to VeriChain to obtain blockchain-backed proof of its authenticity, which can then be shared.- **A Content Creator Protects Original Work:** A YouTuber or artist uses VeriChain to stamp their video with a digital signature. If the work is later altered, its original state can be verified.- **A Viewer Detects a Synthetic Video:** Before resharing a video, a social media user checks it on VeriChain to determine if it is a DeepFake, helping to stop the spread of fake content.---## \u2705 MVP - Current Status**VeriChain currently provides a full verification cycle:**- **Upload:** Users can upload a photo or video for verification.- **Detect:** The AI model analyzes the content for signs of AI generation or manipulation.- **Record:** The result and a unique file fingerprint (hash) are recorded on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain.---## \ud83c\udf31 SDG Contributions- **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions):** Helps fight disinformation, ensuring truth in media, elections, and legal settings.- **SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure):** Builds resilient digital infrastructure using decentralized technology to ensure media integrity.---## \ud83d\udcc4 LicenseCopyright (c) 2025 - BCC NonceSense---## **Built with \u2764\ufe0f on Internet Computer Protocol**",

    "Team description": "# 1. Project Overview**TradingRadar**\u00a0is an intelligent bot solution designed specifically for the Internet Computer (ICP) ecosystem, integrating market monitoring, AI-driven signal analysis, and automated trading. We are dedicated to consolidating fragmented on-chain trading information from the ICP network. By leveraging powerful data analytics and automation tools, we aim to lower the entry barrier for users, help them accurately capture trading opportunities, and achieve asset growth. Our final product will be delivered as a powerful and user-friendly Telegram Bot.**One-line Pitch: The most trading-savvy AI bot on the ICP chain.**# 2. VisionOur vision is to become one of the core trading infrastructures in the ICP ecosystem. Through TradingRadar, both novice investors and seasoned traders can participate in ICP's DeFi and MEME ecosystems with lower costs and higher efficiency. We aim to break down information silos and technical barriers, making advanced trading strategies accessible to every ICP user.# 3. Problem StatementCurrently, traders in the ICP ecosystem face numerous challenges:- **Severe Information Silos:**\u00a0Price quotes and trading volume data are scattered across multiple DEXs like ICPSwap, ICDex, and Sonic. Information on launchpad projects, MEME news on Twitter, and community sentiment is even more disorganized. Users spend significant time and effort on manual consolidation, which is highly inefficient.- **Fleeting Opportunities:**\u00a0High-value opportunities, such as sniping new coin launches (Launchpads) or capitalizing on arbitrage between different DEXs, demand millisecond-level reaction speeds. Manual operations make it nearly impossible to seize these chances.- **High Technical Barrier:**\u00a0Writing and deploying sniper bots and arbitrage bots requires deep programming and blockchain knowledge, effectively shutting out the vast majority of regular users.- **Lack of Effective Decision-Making Tools:**\u00a0The market is filled with noise, making it difficult for users to filter out genuinely valuable trading signals from a sea of information. There is a lack of intelligent analysis tools that combine market data with public sentiment to aid decision-making.# 4. SolutionTradingRadar systematically addresses the above pain points through four core modules, providing users with a one-stop, automated trading experience.### **Module 1: Panoramic Real-time Market Monitoring**- **Functionality:**\u00a0Aggregates real-time trading pair data from mainstream DEXs on the ICP chain (ICPSwap, ICDex, Sonic, etc.).- **Key Metrics:**\u00a0Monitors critical features such as price volatility, trading volume changes, liquidity pool depth, and large-volume trades (Whale Alerts).- **User Value:**\u00a0Provides a unified, real-time market data dashboard, helping users quickly grasp the overall market situation and never miss any significant movements.### **Module 2: AI-Driven Signals & Insights**- **Functionality:**\u00a0Conducts intelligent analysis by combining on-chain data with off-chain information.    - **Launchpad Monitoring:**\u00a0Automatically scrapes and pushes the latest launchpad project information, IDO schedules, and participation rules.    - **Social Sentiment Analysis:**\u00a0Monitors ICP-related projects, KOLs, and MEME topics on Twitter, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis, hot topic tracking, and trend identification.    - **AI Decision Engine:**\u00a0Fuses market trends, trading data, and social sentiment, using machine learning models to classify and analyze information, generate high-probability investment suggestions and short-term trend forecasts, and deliver them to users via the Telegram Bot.### **Module 3: Automated Trading Execution Bots**- **Functionality:**\u00a0Offers two core automated trading tools.    - **Launchpad Sniper Bot:**\u00a0Users simply pre-set parameters (e.g., project, purchase amount, gas fee), and the bot will automatically execute a buy order at the fastest possible speed the instant a project's liquidity pool is created, securing a first-mover advantage.    - **Cross-DEX Arbitrage Bot:**\u00a0Monitors price discrepancies between different DEXs 24/7. Upon detecting a profitable arbitrage opportunity, it automatically completes the \"buy-low, sell-high\" cross-platform trading loop.### **Module 4: Telegram Bot Integration**- **Functionality:**\u00a0All features will be integrated into a simple, easy-to-use Telegram Bot.- **User Experience:**    - **Convenient Management:**\u00a0Users can set up monitoring, configure bots, and manage wallets using conversational commands.    - **Real-time Feedback:**\u00a0All market alerts, AI signals, and trade success/failure notifications are pushed to the user's Telegram in real time.    - **One-Click Trading:**\u00a0After receiving a trading signal, users can authorize and execute trades directly within Telegram, enabling a seamless \"analysis-decision-trade\" workflow.# 5. Technical Architecture- **Data Ingestion Layer:**    - **On-Chain Data:**\u00a0Interacts directly with the Ledger Canister and various DEX Canisters on the ICP chain, fetching real-time, trustworthy on-chain data via Agent-rs/Agent-js.    - **Off-Chain Data:**\u00a0Acquires Launchpad and social media information through the Twitter API, official project announcements, and web crawlers.- **Backend Service Layer:**    - **Language Stack:**\u00a0The backend will be built using Rust or Python. Rust ensures high performance and security, ideal for the core trading execution logic; Python offers a rich ecosystem for data processing and AI model integration.    - **AI Engine:**\u00a0Utilizes frameworks like PyTorch / TensorFlow, along with libraries such as Transformers for NLP analysis and time-series forecasting model training and deployment.    - **Database:**\u00a0Employs a time-series database like TimescaleDB or InfluxDB for storing market data to facilitate efficient querying and analysis; uses PostgreSQL for user information and configurations.    - **Deployment:**\u00a0Deployed using containerization (Docker) on cloud servers (e.g., AWS, GCP) or on DFINITY's decentralized cloud services to ensure high availability and scalability.- **Frontend & Interaction Layer:**    - **Telegram Bot API:**\u00a0Uses libraries like\u00a0python-telegram-bot\u00a0to build the user interface and message push channels.    - **Security:**\u00a0User private keys or mnemonic phrases will be encrypted and stored locally on the user's device or managed through a secure key management solution. The backend service never directly accesses user private keys; trades are executed via user-signed authorizations.# 6. Business ModelWe will adopt a Freemium and subscription-based model to ensure the project's sustainable development.- **Free Tier:**    - Provides basic price volatility alerts.    - Offers a limited number of AI signal pushes.- **Pro Tier (Subscription-based):**    - Unlocks all advanced market monitoring features (e.g., Whale Alerts).    - Provides unlimited access to AI signals and in-depth analysis reports.    - Grants access to the Launchpad Sniper Bot and Cross-DEX Arbitrage Bot.- **Profit Sharing (Optional):**    - For profits generated by the arbitrage bot, we may take a small percentage (e.g., 5-10%) as a service fee to deeply align our interests with those of our users.# 7. Hackathon Goals & DeliverablesTo demonstrate the core value of the project within the limited time of the hackathon, we will focus on delivering a demonstrable Minimum Viable Product (MVP):1. **Complete Core Data Monitoring Module:**\u00a0Successfully integrate real-time price and volume data from at least one major DEX (e.g., ICPSwap).2. **Build Basic Telegram Bot Framework:**\u00a0Allow users to add the bot and subscribe to price fluctuation alerts for specific trading pairs via commands.3. **Implement Core MVP Feature:**\u00a0When a monitored trading pair's price fluctuates beyond a set threshold (e.g., 5%) within a specified timeframe, the bot will instantly send an alert to subscribed users.4. **Project Demonstration:**\u00a0Through a live demo, clearly showcase how TradingRadar captures market anomalies in real time and notifies users via the Telegram Bot, while also articulating the full project vision and future roadmap.",

    "Team description": "Decentralized Event TicketingThe **Decentralized Event Ticketing Platform** is built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, providing a fully decentralized, tamper-proof foundation for hosting both the frontend and backend within secure smart canisters. By eliminating reliance on centralized ticketing intermediaries or cloud providers, the platform ensures transparency, security, and trust for organizers and attendees alike.Leveraging the unique capabilities of ICP \u2014 such as scalable canisters, on-chain data storage, and low-latency execution \u2014 the system delivers a robust infrastructure for issuing, verifying, and transferring event tickets as **blockchain tokens**. This guarantees that every ticket is unique, traceable, and impossible to counterfeit or duplicate, effectively solving long-standing issues like fraud, fake tickets, and ticket scalping.At the core of the platform is a **fair-access model** where buyers have full confidence in the authenticity and provenance of their tickets. Using secure blockchain identities and intuitive interfaces, users can purchase, verify, and transfer tickets peer-to-peer without middlemen or hidden fees. Smart contracts automatically enforce rules for issuance, resale, and transfer, ensuring transparent pricing and eliminating black-market reselling.To further protect buyers and organizers, the system supports programmable resale conditions. For example, organizers can cap resale prices or control when and how tickets can be transferred \u2014 stopping unfair price gouging and keeping events accessible.The frontend is built with modern web technologies (React & TypeScript) while the backend smart contract logic is written in **Rust**, ensuring high performance and security. All interactions \u2014 from ticket purchase to verification at the venue \u2014 are recorded immutably on-chain, guaranteeing full auditability.Overall, this build combines **decentralization**, **tokenization**, and **smart contract automation** to disrupt traditional ticketing models and deliver a next-generation solution for live events. It empowers event creators and fans with a more secure, fair, and transparent experience, while laying the groundwork for future innovation in digital ticketing and decentralized marketplaces.---## \u2728 **Key Benefits**- Fraud-proof, unique, tokenized tickets- No centralized ticket middlemen- Resale and transfer rules enforced by smart contracts- On-chain transparency for buyers and organizers- Fully hosted on the Internet Computer \u2014 no external cloud servers---## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Core Tech**- **Blockchain:** Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)- **Backend:** Rust-based smart contracts (canisters)- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS- **Identity:** Internet Identity for secure login",

This results in chronic vulnerability, significant economic losses from preventable diseases, and a major barrier to formal BFAR accreditation.## Solution**LikAI** is an **AI-powered web application and digital platform** designed to democratize access to expert-level biosecurity and GAqP guidance. It functions as a **personalized, adaptive biosecurity coach**, transforming complex protocols into simple, incremental, and affordable action plans explicitly tailored to each farm's unique profile and resource constraints.**LikAI** empowers farmers to proactively build resilient, disease-resistant farms, ensuring healthier shrimp and more profitable harvests.## **The Impact for Farmers**The result is a more resilient, profitable, and compliant farm. LikAI empowers farmers to proactively prevent diseases, increase their yields, and confidently achieve the BFAR certification needed to grow their business.---## Features### Core Features- **Personalized Biosecurity & GAqP Action Plans:** AI-generated, visual, step-by-step plans tailored to your farm's unique profile for clear GAqP compliance.- **AI Coach & Knowledge Assistant:** Your 24/7 AI chatbot providing instant, expert, and contextual advice via text, voice, or photo input.- **Smart Investment Guidance:** AI-driven recommendations for cost-effective farm upgrades, showing clear ROI to boost your profitability.- **Practical Biosecurity Library:** A comprehensive, visual hub of GAqP-aligned guides and tutorials for continuous learning and problem-solving.### Other- **Offline Support:** Access your personalized plans and critical guides anytime, anywhere, even without an internet connection.- **Mobile-Friendly UI:** An intuitive, visually clear interface designed for easy use on any smartphone, ensuring seamless navigation for all farmers.---## How LikAI leverages ICP?### Personalized Biosecurity & GAqP Action Plans: - The plan generation logic and the storage of the farmer's assessment data and the resulting dynamic plan would be in canisters. The plan's evolution is tamper-proof.### AI Coach & Knowledge Assistant: - The chat interface, chat history, and the logic for contextualizing prompts for external LLMs (via HTTPs outcalls) would be canister-based. The \"Practical Biosecurity Library\" content itself could be hosted in canisters for immutability.### Smart Investment Guidance: - The logic for calculating ROI, generating investment recommendations, and storing the farmer's investment plans would run in canisters.### Compliance & Market Access (Future/Enterprise): - The generation of compliance reports and the storage of certification data would leverage canisters for immutable record-keeping and verifiable outputs.---## DifficultiesTeam Communication- Team members balancing the project with existing full-time jobs or other substantial commitments. This leads to difficulties in maintaining consistent momentum, ensuring timely task completion, and coordinating efforts effectively due to fluctuating availability and differing schedulesTechnical Difficulties- AI RAG & HTTPs Outcalls    - We still lack a technical knowledge on how to leverage HTTPs Outcalls in ICP. We are still currently training our local LLAMA model for our RAG implementation.---## Future PlansMarket Validation- We will give more time on testing our features with different stakeholders. This will also help us test our riskiest assumptions.Partnerships- Present our MVP to BFAR to gather more feedback and insights. This will also help us gather necessary resources for our RAG training.Product-Market Fit- After the hackathon, the team will execute our go-to-market strategies to attain product-market fit.---## DeploymentGitHub repository: [Web3-Iligan/LikAI](https://github.com/Web3-Iligan/LikAI)Frontend Canister:Backend Canister:---### DocumentationPitch Deck: [Audience \u00b7 LikAI Pitch deck - Figma Slides](https://www.figma.com/deck/Iv5qTldxzcYekD2zg5zhH0/LikAI-Pitch-deck?node-id=96-62&t=Wz7MVfIc6RALpirX-1)User Flow Diagram: [User Flow Diagram | Getting Started](https://sentient-solutions.gitbook.io/likai-ai-biosecurity-coach/project-documentation/user-flow-diagram)Complete Architecture: [https://www.figma.com/board/syQhFMFQwXtq5MEzN1CRQ1/LikAI-System-Architecture?node-id=0-1&t=yqoxvWUmbZ9ccyqa-1](https://www.figma.com/board/syQhFMFQwXtq5MEzN1CRQ1/LikAI-System-Architecture?node-id=0-1&t=yqoxvWUmbZ9ccyqa-1)Video Pitch:Demo Video:We also created a documentation using GitBooks: [Project Overview | Getting Started](https://sentient-solutions.gitbook.io/likai-ai-biosecurity-coach/overview/project-overview)---## Team Information1.

\"meeting\".User can also upload a meeting themselves, with video-cam and screenshare-cam support.If user is subscribed, user can enable the \"Subtitles\" AI feature to automatically generate subtitles for the video!## DocumentationTo learn more before you start working with **AsyncE**, see the following documentation available online:- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)## Running the project locallyIf you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:```# Starts the replica, running in the backgrounddfx start --background# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interfacedfx deploy```javascriptOnce the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.Since AsyncE uses WebSocket, you need to set up the WebSocket gateway locally:```# Navigate to a directory where you want to clone the repositorycd path/to/your/directory# Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/omnia-network/ic-websocket-gateway.git](https://github.com/omnia-network/ic-websocket-gateway.git)```javascriptRun the WebSocket Gateway```# Navigate into the cloned repositorycd ic-websocket-gateway# Build and run the gateway in release modecargo run --release```javascriptIf you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with```npm run generate```javascriptat any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with```npm start```javascriptWhich will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.### Note on frontend environment variablesIf you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:-   set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack-   use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations    -   Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations-   Write your own `createActor` constructor## Running The Python Server For Video EditingWe use Python to concatonate videos, generate thumbnails, and generate subtitles with AI.To run the python server, we would need python installed, specifically version 3.10 - 3.12Then, we can start our python environment and install the dependencies required by:```python3.12 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activatepython3.12 -m pip install -r src/video_editor_backend/requirements.txt```javascriptThen, we can run it by executing the command below:```cd src/video_editor_backend/python app.py```javascript## Getting Started- **Login**:    - Visit the **AsyncE** homepage.  - Log in using the **DFINITY authentication** system.- **Profile Setup**:  - If you're a new user, a dialog will prompt you to:        - Create a username.    - Upload a profile picture.- **Subscription**:    - Use your initial **coins** to purchase subscriptions.  - Access premium features with a subscription.- **Create Groups**:  - Initiate new groups by:        - Providing a group name.    - Selecting a profile picture.- **Invite Members**:  - Add friends, family, or colleagues to your groups.- **Start Collaborating**:  - Begin:        - Chatting.    - Sharing videos.    - Organizing meetings asynchronously.## How It Works- **Group Management**:  - Owners and admins can invite or remove members.  - Admins can promote other members to admin status.  - **Ownership remains exclusive**; admins cannot remove the owner.- **Meetings**:  - Each group can host multiple meetings.  - Meetings serve as hubs for:        - Video recordings.    - Discussions.- **Video Interaction**:  - Record videos directly within a meeting.  - After recording, save your video with a custom title.  - Choose to add subtitles if you're a subscribed user.  - Videos are processed and then appear in the group's video gallery.- **Chat Functionality**:  - Use the group's chat window for instant messaging.  - Edit or delete messages to keep conversations clear and up-to-date.",

    "Team description": "# Bridging the Governance Gap Between Web2 and Web3  **Enugu, Nigeria** - In an era demanding greater transparency and inclusivity, many traditional organizations are finding their decision-making processes outdated and opaque. Addressing this critical need, **\"DAOFlow: Web2 to Web3 Governance Bridge\"** proposes an innovative solution: an **on-chain governance dApp** designed to modernize organizational decision-making through blockchain technology and artificial intelligence.  ## Problems  The core challenge lies in **\"Organizational Governance,\"** where:  - **Traditional systems are outdated and opaque**, hindering stakeholder understanding of decision-making processes.  - **Lack of inclusive participation** limits input to a select few, often causing dissatisfaction among broader members.  ## Solution  DAOFlow\u2019s solution transforms governance with:  ### 1. **On-Chain Governance dApp**     - Decision-making recorded and executed on a **blockchain**, ensuring immutability and transparency.     - **Decentralized framework** reduces reliance on central authorities, distributing power among participants.  ### 2. **AI-Powered Telegram Onboarding**     - Simplifies **Web3 onboarding** via Telegram, leveraging AI to guide users unfamiliar with blockchain.  ### 3. **Real-Time Analytics**     - Provides insights into **voting patterns, proposal progress, and engagement**, enabling data-driven decisions.  ### 4. **Secure Voting**     - **Cryptographic security** ensures anonymous (if desired) and tamper-proof voting, building trust in the process.  ## Why DAOFlow?  By merging **blockchain transparency** with **AI-driven accessibility**, DAOFlow bridges the gap between:  - **Traditional (Web2) governance** \u2013 centralized, opaque, and exclusionary.  - **Decentralized (Web3) governance** \u2013 transparent, inclusive, and community-driven.",

    "Team description": "# Revolutionizing Ride-Sharing with Blockchain for Transparency and Privacy  **Enugu, Nigeria** \u2014 The modern ride-sharing economy, while convenient, suffers from **high fees, opaque pricing, and privacy risks**. Addressing these issues, **\"ChainMove: Ride-Sharing Reimagined with Blockchain\"** introduces a **decentralized ride platform** on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, offering transparent fares, privacy protection, and cost-sharing innovations.  ## Problems in the Current Ride-Sharing Economy  1. **High Service Fees**     - Centralized platforms impose hefty commissions, inflating costs for riders and reducing driver earnings.  2. **Opaque Pricing**     - Unclear surge pricing and hidden fees leave users uncertain about final fares.  3. **Data Privacy Risks**     - Users have **limited control** over personal data, which is often harvested and monetized by corporations.  ## ChainMove\u2019s Solution: A Decentralized Ride Platform on ICP  Built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, ChainMove leverages blockchain to redefine ride-sharing:  ### 1. Transparent Fares     - **Smart contracts** automate fare calculations and driver payouts, recorded immutably on-chain.     - No hidden fees; riders and drivers see **real-time breakdowns** of costs and commissions.  ### 2. Privacy Protection     - **Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and encryption minimize data exposure.     - Users retain ownership of personal data, shared only with explicit consent.  ### 3. Cost-Sharing Innovations     - **Decentralized carpooling**: Riders can split fares peer-to-peer via smart contracts.     - Dynamic pricing models reward frequent users and drivers fairly.  ### 4. ICP Integration Advantages     - **Scalability**: ICP\u2019s low-latency network supports high transaction throughput.     - **User-friendly onboarding**: Internet Identity allows seamless, passwordless logins.     - **Tamper-proof records**: All rides and payments are auditable on-chain.  ## Conclusion  ChainMove harnesses **ICP\u2019s decentralized infrastructure** to create a ride-sharing ecosystem that is:  \u2705 **Transparent** (fares, rules, and fees visible to all).  \u2705 **Private** (user-controlled data, no corporate surveillance).  \u2705 **Equitable** (lower costs for riders, fair pay for drivers).  By shifting power from corporations to users, ChainMove redefines urban mobility for the **Web3 era**.",

This eliminates reliance on centralized cloud services and enhances transparency. Leveraging the unique capabilities of ICP, such as seamless scaling, on-chain data storage, and low-latency performance, the platform ensures robust and resilient infrastructure for critical health data exchange.At the heart of the platform is a **patient-centric model**, where individuals have full ownership and control over their health data. Using secure digital identities powered by Internet Identity or Passkeys, patients can log in without passwords and manage their records through a clean, intuitive interface. Every data access or modification is permissioned and traceable, ensuring accountability and transparency. Patients can selectively grant access to healthcare providers or researchers based on their preferences, timeframes, or specific datasets.The platform integrates **privacy-preserving technologies** such as encryption at rest and in transit, and optionally, zero-knowledge proofs for verifying certain data points without exposing the actual data. Access policies are governed by smart contracts that define rules for sharing, revoking, or monetizing data. This ensures that only authorized parties can view or use the information, with all actions being logged immutably on-chain.In addition to data sharing, the platform introduces a **data monetization module**, allowing patients to earn from their anonymized data. Researchers or healthcare organizations can request specific types of datasets, and patients who meet those criteria can choose to participate. The system ensures transparency in transactions and offers patients incentives while maintaining their privacy and consent rights.Overall, the build combines decentralization, patient empowerment, and advanced cryptographic protections to create a revolutionary health data exchange ecosystem. It not only addresses the current issues of data silos and privacy breaches but also opens new possibilities for collaborative medical research and personalized care.",

Whether you're launching a new protocol or upgrading an existing app, Blackhole lets you skip months of fragile execution logic and ship with battle-tested infrastructure from day one.Through a single SDK, teams get a full-stack execution system that includes:\u2014 Intent parsing & route discovery\u2014 Structural threat filtering via Umbra, our pre-signature ML-enhanced firewall\u2014 Behavioral risk scoring via Echo, an offchain reputation engine\u2014 Automatic fallback logic with SafeSwitch, signed upfront and triggered at runtime\u2014 Onchain, non-custodial execution via GravCore, our runtime-aware smart contractInstead of writing thousands of lines of custom execution code, developers can integrate Blackhole in under five minutes \u2014 and immediately gain a modular, auditable, and fallback-protected execution flow.Every transaction is validated before signature, enriched with contract- and protocol-level metadata, and routed through deterministic paths. If something breaks at runtime \u2014 fallback logic kicks in. If it can't be saved \u2014 execution halts safely. No asset loss. No surprises.Blackhole is fully modular. Use the full stack \u2014 or embed specific components. You own the UX. We handle everything after \"Sign.\"Blackhole standardizes one of the most error-prone parts of DeFi \u2014 execution \u2014 and makes it safe by default.",

    "Team description": "## **Problem Statement**Despite being a leader in financial innovation, Africa\u2019s mobile money ecosystem continues to face systemic inefficiencies that limit its potential for true financial inclusion and economic empowerment:- **High Transaction Costs:** The average cost of sending $200 across African borders is around 8.2% \u2014significantly higher than the global average of 6.3% (World Bank, 2023). Domestic cash-out fees can reach up to 4\u20136%, eating into the incomes of low-income users.- **Limited Interoperability:** Over 130 million mobile money accounts exist in Sub-Saharan Africa (GSMA, 2023), yet most operate in silos. Less than 15% of mobile money platforms are interoperable across networks or countries, forcing users to maintain multiple wallets and pay extra for conversions.- **Fragmented Financial Access:** While mobile money penetration has grown, only 43% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to formal financial services (Findex, World Bank 2021). Cross-border remittances cost an average of $7 billion annually in fees due to inefficient corridors and middlemen.- **Digital Divide Leaves Millions Behind:** Over 60% of Africans still use feature phones without smartphone capabilities (Statista, 2023), locking them out of modern fintech apps and DeFi innovations. Most blockchain-based financial solutions are app-only, excluding the majority from participating in the digital economy.These barriers not only increase costs and reduce efficiency but also perpetuate financial exclusion for millions of Africans who rely on mobile money as their primary financial tool. Without a unified, low-cost, and inclusive infrastructure, the promise of universal financial access remains unfulfilled.\u00a0This creates a critical need for a new kind of financial rail, one that combines the ubiquity of USSD, the security and transparency of blockchain, and the efficiency of stablecoins to serve all Africans, regardless of device, location, or income level.## **Solution****AfriTokeni** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain that bridges the gap between traditional mobile money systems and modern blockchain technology. It enables fast, secure, and low-cost financial transactions for all Africans, regardless of whether they use smartphones or basic feature phones via USSD.By leveraging stablecoins pegged to local currencies (e.g., USD-backed), **AfriTokeni** provides a unified, interoperable, and borderless payment layer that works seamlessly across devices and networks.### **How It Works**1. **Universal Access via Dual Interface**    - **Smartphone Users:** Use the **AfriTokeni** mobile app (Android/iOS) to transact securely using biometrics, PINs    - **Feature Phone Users:** Access all core services via *USSD code (789#), no internet required. This ensures inclusivity across urban and rural populations.2. **Secure Onboarding**    - Users register using:        - Mobile phone number        - National ID (verified via government APIs or agent-assisted KYC)        - Biometric data or PIN    - Registration can be done:        - Self-service via app        - Agent-assisted, where trusted agents help users complete KYC and create accounts3. **Core Functions**    - Every user can perform the following actions via the app or USSD :        - **Send Money:** Instantly transfer stablecoins to any registered user.        - **Receive Money:** Get funds from anyone on the network.        - **Check Balance:** View real-time balance.        - **Withdraw Cash:** Convert stablecoins into physical cash through a trusted agent network.4. **Cash Withdrawal Process (Agent-Based Liquidity Model)**    - To withdraw cash:        - User initiates withdrawal via USSD or app        - The system displays nearby verified agents with real-time availability        - The user selects the preferred agent based on proximity        - PIN authentication ensures transaction security        - Unique verification code generated and sent to the user's phone        - The user presents code to the agent for validation        - Agent confirms code validity and dispenses cash        - Automatic blockchain settlement updates both the user and agent balances",

    "Team description": "This proposal outlines the development of an innovative real estate tokenisation platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. ICP-RWA (Real World Assets) aims to transform traditional real estate investment by fractionalizing property ownership, improving liquidity, reducing entry barriers, and creating a transparent marketplace for global investors. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the Internet Computer protocol, ICP-RWA will provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for tokenizing real-world property assets.## Problem StatementThe current real estate investment landscape presents several challenges:- **High Barriers to Entry:** Traditional real estate investments require substantial capital, excluding many potential investors- **Liquidity Constraints:** Real estate assets are highly illiquid, with transactions typically taking months to complete- **Geographical Limitations:** Investors face difficulties accessing international property markets due to regulatory and practical constraints- **Fragmented Documentation:** Property ownership records are often stored in siloed, centralized systems prone to errors and fraud- **Intermediary Dependence:** Multiple intermediaries increase transaction costs and slow down processes## Proposed SolutionICP-RWA will create a comprehensive platform for tokenizing real estate assets, offering:### Core Features- **Property Tokenisation:** Convert real-world properties into digital tokens representing fractional ownership- **Regulatory-Compliant Marketplace:** A secure exchange for buying, selling, and trading property tokens- **Smart Contract-Based Governance:** Automated management of ownership rights, dividends, and voting- **Digital Property Passports:** Immutable records of property details, history, and ownership- **Integrated Legal Framework:** Collaboration with legal experts to ensure compliance across jurisdictions### Benefits of Internet Computer Implementation- **Web-Speed Performance:** Near-instant transaction finality compared to traditional blockchains- **Scalability:** Handle high transaction volumes without prohibitive gas fees- **Cost-Efficiency:** Lower operational costs through IC's reverse gas model- **Web3 Integration:** Native support for decentralized identity and authentication- **Chain-Key Cryptography:** Enhanced security for multi-signature property transactions- **Full-Stack Platform:** Frontend and backend entirely on-chain, eliminating traditional hosting needs## Technical Architecture### Components- **Property Tokenisation Module:** Canister for creating and managing property tokens- **Decentralized Exchange:** On-chain marketplace for token trading- **Identity & Verification System:** KYC/AML compliance tools leveraging Internet Identity- **Property Management Dashboard:** Interface for property owners and investors- **Governance Canister:** Voting mechanisms for property-related decisions- **Oracle Integration:** Connection to real-world data feeds for property valuations### Implementation ApproachThe platform will be built using:- **Motoko:** Primary programming language for canister development- **Rust:** For performance-critical components requiring low-level control- **Internet Identity:** For secure, anonymous authentication- **Asset Canister:** For efficient storage of property documentation and media- **HTTPS Outcalls:** For integrating with external real estate databases and services## Security ConsiderationsPropToken will implement robust security measures:- **Multi-signature Authorization:** For property tokenisation and large transactions- **Threshold Cryptography:** For distributed key management- **Regular Security Audits:** By third-party blockchain security firms- **Regulatory Compliance Framework:** To meet global real estate and securities regulations- **Secure Escrow Mechanisms:** For property token transactions## Market OpportunityThe global real estate market is valued at approximately $327 trillion, with only a small fraction currently accessible through tokenisation. PropToken targets:- **Individual Investors:** Seeking fractional ownership in premium properties- **Property Developers:** Looking to raise capital through innovative funding models- **Investment Funds:** Seeking to diversify portfolios with tokenized real estate- **Property Management Companies:** Aiming to streamline operations- **Cross-Border Investors:** Looking for international real estate exposure## Use CasesPropToken enables numerous innovative applications:- **Fractional Ownership:** Invest in high-value properties with as little as $100- **Real Estate Liquidity Pools:** Create diversified portfolios across property types and locations- **Automated Rental Income Distribution:** Smart contracts handle tenant payments and investor dividends- **Transparent Property Valuation:** Real-time market data feeds for accurate pricing- **Decentralized Property Management:** Community governance for maintenance decisions",

It dismantles the traditional, centralized model of education by empowering a global community of educators and learners. Instead of relying on a single institution, Savant leverages a dynamic ecosystem of experts, creators, and learners, all incentivized through a robust token economy. Our mission is to ensure that educational content is perpetually current, relevant, and accessible to everyone, everywhere.At the core of the platform is the **$SAVANT token**, the governance and utility token that powers the entire ecosystem. It facilitates a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling community-driven decision-making on the protocol's future. $SAVANT is designed to reward valuable contributions, align incentives, and foster a self-sustaining educational economy where all participants, including AI, have a stake.---### **Tokenomics: The $SAVANT Economy**The Savant ecosystem is powered by a dual-token model designed to separate governance and utility from daily transactions, ensuring stability and long-term growth.#### **$SAVANT Token**$SAVANT is the native governance and utility token of the platform.- **Governance:** $SAVANT holders can participate in the Savant DAO, vote on key protocol decisions, and shape the future of the platform.- **Staking & Access:** Users can stake $SAVANT tokens to gain unlimited access to all educational content on the platform.- **Contribution & Curation:** To ensure quality and commitment, Expert Curators and Content Creators must pay a fee in $SAVANT to submit lesson plans and content. This fee is at risk, creating a strong incentive for high-quality submissions.- **Protocol Interaction Fees:** All significant actions on the platform require a fee paid in $SAVANT. This includes minting certificates and, in later phases, actions performed by autonomous AI agents. This ensures that every operation, whether human or machine-driven, contributes to the economic flywheel of the ecosystem.- **Rewards:** In the initial phase, $SAVANT will be distributed as rewards to Expert Curators, Content Creators, and Exam Creators for their valuable contributions.#### **Stablecoins ($USDC/$USDT)**- **Content Access:** Learners can pay for individual lesson plans using stablecoins like $USDC or $USDT. This provides a stable and straightforward payment method for end-users.---### **Ecosystem Personas**Savant's success relies on the symbiotic relationship between key personas:- **Expert Curators:** These are subject matter experts responsible for designing comprehensive curricula. They curate content from various creators, develop lesson plans, and assemble relevant exams to create a cohesive learning experience.- **Content Creators:** The primary producers of educational materials, including articles, videos, and interactive modules. They are rewarded based on the adoption and success of their content within lesson plans.- **Exam Creators:** Specialists who contribute to the learning process by creating and submitting high-quality test items. Their work helps validate a learner's understanding of a topic.- **Learners:** The end-users of the platform. Learners seek up-to-date knowledge and can access it either through single-purchase transactions or by staking $SAVANT for unlimited access.---### **Platform Features**#### **1. Decentralized Lesson Plan Creation & Curation**- **Submission:** An Expert Curator initiates the creation of a new lesson plan by paying a fee in $SAVANT. They can create their own content, select high-quality content from other creators (including existing YouTube videos), and integrate exams from the community repository.- **Peer Review & Validation:** Each new lesson plan undergoes a public beta phase. Users who have staked $SAVANT can access the plan for free and are incentivized to provide honest feedback. If the community review is overwhelmingly negative, the Expert Curator forfeits their initial $SAVANT fee, ensuring only the highest quality content prevails.- **Community Collaboration:** Expert Curators can source exams from the community. Exam Creators are also required to pay a nominal $SAVANT fee to submit their work, which is at risk if the content is not accepted or is of poor quality.#### **2. Flexible Lesson Plan Modules**- Once a lesson plan passes the community review process, it becomes publicly available. Learners have two options for access:    - **Pay-Per-Course:** Purchase access to a single lesson plan using $USDC or $USDT.    - **Premium Access:** Stake $SAVANT to unlock unlimited access to all content across the entire platform.#### **3. On-Chain Certificate Minting**- Upon successful completion of a lesson plan, learners can mint a unique, verifiable certificate as a Soul-Bound Token (SBT) or NFT. This on-chain credential, branded by the Expert Curator, serves as a permanent and transferable record of the learner's achievement. Learners must pay a nominal fee in $SAVANT to mint their certificate.---### **Financial Model**#### **Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)**A portion of the platform's revenue will be allocated to a Protocol Owned Liquidity fund. This fund will generate yield through DeFi strategies, creating a sustainable treasury to finance ongoing development, operations, and reward distributions to $SAVANT stakers.#### **Revenue Distribution**Revenue generated from lesson plan sales ($USDC/$USDT) will be distributed automatically via smart contracts:- **Expert Curators:** 50%- **Content & Exam Creators:** 40%- **Platform Treasury (DAO):** 10%---### **Initial Roadmap**The development and launch of Savant will proceed in four distinct phases:#### **Phase 1: Foundation & Community Building (Incentivized Creation)**- **Objective:** To bootstrap the platform with a critical mass of high-quality educational content.- **Execution:** During this phase, the creation of lesson plans, content, and exams will be **FREE**. The $SAVANT fee for submissions will be waived.- **Incentives:** Expert Curators, Content Creators, and Exam Creators will be rewarded with $SAVANT tokens for creating lesson plans that achieve significant user engagement (e.g., >200 successful completions with positive feedback).#### **Phase 2: Monetization & Staking Activation**- **Trigger:** The platform successfully hosts at least 10 high-quality lesson plans, each with a minimum of 1,000 positive feedback instances.- **Execution:** The payment system will be activated. New users must now either pay for content with $USDC/$USDT or stake $SAVANT for premium access. The initial $SAVANT submission fee for creators will also be implemented.#### **Phase 3: Scaling & Verifiable Credentials**- **Objective:** To enhance the value proposition for learners and bridge the gap between education and employment.- **Execution:** We will focus on scaling the platform by introducing a system of verified credentials. These on-chain certificates will be designed to be recognized by employers, providing learners with tangible career benefits and establishing Savant as a legitimate source for professional development.#### **Phase 4: AI Integration & Economic Participation**- **Objective:** To leverage Artificial Intelligence as an economic participant for quality assurance, content personalization, and enhanced learning experiences.- **Execution:**    - **Structured Content Framework:** We will implement a standardized data structure for all lesson plans. This will allow AI models to accurately \"scrape,\" parse, and understand the relationship between different content modules, videos, and exams within a curriculum.    - **Autonomous AI Agents:** We will develop on-chain AI agents that can perform tasks such as auditing content for quality, verifying links, and flagging outdated material. These agents will be required to hold and spend **$SAVANT** to pay for the computational costs of their actions, fully integrating them into the platform's economy.    - **AI-Powered Curation Tools:** Develop AI assistants for Expert Curators. These tools, powered by the fee-paying autonomous agents, will provide suggestions and analytics to help curators improve the quality and coherence of their lesson plans.    - **Personalized Learning Paths:** By understanding the lesson content, the AI will be able to guide learners. It can suggest prerequisite courses for beginners or recommend advanced modules and supplementary materials to learners who have mastered the core concepts, creating a truly adaptive learning journey.",

    "Team description": "We're on a mission to build the best AI chat app ever!Features:- Clean & familar UI. Think ChatGPT + Notion. - Parallel conversations. - Converse with images & documents. - Branching conversations. - Universal credit. Clear usage. - Customizable themes.---Hey, it's Auden, creator of One AI Chat \ud83d\udc4bI use ChatGPT and Claude a lot. With lots of great new and exciting models coming out from Google, xAI, Meta, Deepseek, and more, I wanted to try out the best models from these providers but didn\u2019t want to pay for so many pro subscriptions. Also, as a software engineer who specializes in web & application development for the past 11 years, I believe that I can make a really great chat app. That\u2019s why I am so excited to create One AI Chat.Is it another AI/LLMs wrapper?Yes.So why should I use it?Honestly, right now there are a lot of other alternatives. But here's why I think it's useful enough to release it in early access:1. Clear & transparent pricing model. Usage rates are the same as providers' API rates + 10%.2. LLMs responses don't rely on the client connectivity. We use Convex. It's super stable. You can even run multiple chats in parallel.3. Use it if you like the design :)4. We have a very clear roadmap.What's next?A desktop app (Mac & Windows) that lets you start a conversation from anywhere; in the middle of using Excel, PowerPoint, or email, etc. Apple is quite behind on their AI, so a seamless way to use better AI models on the Mac would be amazing.Improving model responses and capabilities with tools. Currently, and the same with a lot of other AI wrappers, their responses are worse than using the same models on the ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini website. We have a plan to significantly improve this.If you do decide to use it or try it out for free, would love to hear your feedback!",

    "Team description": "# ## Executive SummaryThis proposal outlines the development and implementation of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Bridge between the Internet Computer (IC) and The Open Network (TON) blockchains. This interoperability solution aims to facilitate seamless communication, asset transfers, and smart contract interactions between these two leading blockchain ecosystems.## Problem StatementCurrently, IC dApps lack a major distribution platform. This hinders user adoption and success, and ultimately discourages new development on the IC. The TON ecosystem offers major reach via the Telegram messaging app.## Proposed SolutionWe propose building a bidirectional RPC Bridge that enables:- Cross-chain smart contract calls between IC canisters and TON smart contracts- Secure asset transfers between the two networks- Verification of state proofs across chains- Standardized message format for interoperability### Benefits to Internet Computer Ecosystem- **Telegram Integration:** IC developers can expand their reach to Telegram's 800+ million users by deploying applications that interact with TON blockchain- **Enhanced User Base:** Access to TON's growing ecosystem and Telegram's massive user base without requiring users to leave their preferred platform- **Technical Advantages:** Leverage TON's scalability and fast transaction speeds while maintaining IC's robust security and computing capabilities- **Mini App Deployment:** IC developers can create Telegram Mini Apps powered by their Internet Computer backend infrastructure- **Dual-Network Versatility:** Deploy parts of dapps on each network based on their respective strengths (IC for complex computing, TON for user-facing interactions)## Use CasesThe IC-TON RPC Bridge will enable numerous cross-chain applications:- IC application can deploy on Telegram reaching 1 billion users- TON developers can buils Telegram apps on the IC- DeFi applications will leverage liquidity from both ecosystems- Cross-chain NFT marketplaces and transfers- Decentralized exchanges spanning both networks- Multi-chain DAO governance- Cross-chain identity solutions## Technical Architecture### Components- **Bridge Canister on IC:** Responsible for handling messages from TON, verifying TON state proofs, and initiating outbound calls to TON- **Bridge Smart Contract on TON:** Handles messages from IC, verifies IC state proofs, and initiates outbound calls to IC- **Relay Network:** A decentralized network of relayers that monitor both chains and propagate messages between them- **Verification Modules:** Specialized modules for cryptographic verification of cross-chain messages### Implementation ApproachThe bridge will implement a standardized message format with the following workflow:1. Message initiated on source chain (IC or TON)2. Message captured by the bridge contract on source chain3. Relayers detect and propagate the message to the destination chain4. Bridge contract on destination chain verifies the message using cryptographic proofs5. Upon successful verification, the message is executed on the destination chain",

LendRow's current architecture and its enhanced version is transitioned and currently being built using React JS as a frontend interface, the backend architecture was previously built using Motoko and was now transferred to Rust and will soon be deployed under Internet Computer Protocol or ICP. LendRow is now fully on-chain based transactions along with its most secure System Access Authentication using NFID and Internet Identity.\u00a0The LendRow blockchain project is currently 20% done.# The Solutions:- The LendRow solution to Financial Access, is by providing individual lenders and micro-finance institutions a common ground to directly lend and earn money by granting funding or investment opportunities to underserved individuals and small business owners without the need for traditional intermediary. People can borrow quickly and can repay quickly with flexible loan amounts with low interest rates.- The LendRow solution to Debt Management, is by minimizing or preventing borrowers entirely from acquiring multiple concurrent debts with One Debt At A Time Policy, and with credit history based borrowing which helps lenders know their applicants history.- The LendRow solution to Debt Recovery, is by LendRow-guaranteed, collateral-based, and credit score-based lending which help protect lenders from defaults while also safeguarding borrowers from aggressive and predatory lending practices.![lendrow-logo.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198300a40da5e701027d28444a3ad4b8.png)# LendRow BUIDL features:- Frontend - React \u2705- Previous Backend - Motoko \u2705- Current Backend - Rust \u2705- All features were already built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT(AJAX/JQuery), MYSQL and we're currently transferring all the below features under ICP using the above tech stack.# Authentication & Access Control- Internet Identity authentication \u2705- NFID authentication \u2705- Role-based access control (RBAC) \u2014 Admin, Verified User, Pending User \u2705- KYC-gated feature access \u2705# KYC Verification System- ID document upload by users \u2705- Personal data submission \u2705- Admin review interface \u2705- KYC status states: Pending, Approved, Rejected \u2705- KYC-required before wallet, lending, or borrowing access \u2705- Admin-controlled KYC decision actions \u2705# Virtual Wallet System- Cash In (deposit) to your Wallet- Cash Out (withdraw) from your Wallet- Wallet balance tracking- Wallet-identity binding- Transaction logging (with types: CashIn, CashOut, Lend, Repay, Refund)- Canister-level transaction validation# Lender Features- Create loan offers (amount, interest rate, term)- Auto-fund deduction on offer post- Manage active lending terms- Review borrower applications- Approve or reject applications base on their credit history- Auto-generate legally structured lending agreement- Track lending history- Borrowers payment tracking manager# Borrower Features- Browse active loan offers- Apply for loan (single active application policy)- View application history and status- Track credit score/credit history- Make repayments via wallet- Application blocked until debt cleared- Closure agreement auto-generated upon final payment# Agreement Generation- Printable lending agreement- Printable closure agreement on final repayment- Agreement stored immutably per loan# Payment System- Monthly installment tracking- Block multiple debts (single-loan policy enforced)- Digital payment receipts- Transaction record per payment- Admin dashboard for payment monitoring- Real-time loan repayment status# Admin Capabilities- Full system access- KYC approval/rejection- System capital fund setup- Audit access to all borrower/lender records- Access to wallet history, application logs, agreement archives# Canister-Level Controls & Policies- Canister-level input validation- Debt reapplication locked until prior debt is paid- Lending/borrowing restricted to KYC-approved users- Immutable transactional history- Principal-bound wallet and account behavior# Tracking & History- Transaction history (wallet)- Lending history (per lender)- Application history (per borrower)- Payment history (per borrower & per loan)- Credit behavior log for future scoring# **Documents & Records**- Lending agreement document- Closure agreement document- Application record- Payment record- Printable formats for compliance/audit",

    "Team description": "# VOYAGER MANIFESTO### Because freedom begins where power does not reach.### ### Author: [BAS_IC] Team Leader of the [Voyager OG-DEV-Team]### Date: 2025-07-16## Chapter: Introduction## Albert Einstein:\"The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.\"\"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge points to what is, imagination points to what will be.\"\"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.\"## Chapter: ContrastVoyager is a project built on the Internet Computer (ICP) protocol. It is not an ordinary application. It is a technology of many connections that \u2014 in an ideal scenario \u2014 can become a foundation for freedom. To better understand how it works, it\u2019s useful to compare it with other known technologies.## AI as a Search ToolArtificial intelligence can effectively sort content, for example, by automatically recognizing spam. Voyager allows AI to be used in processing data from services and interfaces.## Hidden Wiki on the Tor NetworkThe Tor network hosts decentralized directories like Hidden Wiki. Each one has its own administrator, yet together they form a distributed and censorship-resistant structure. This is similar to how Voyager-DataBoxes interconnect.## HTML and Universal StandardsDespite the variety of browsers, systems, and engines, HTML pages remain compatible with each other. This proves that shared standards can work across differences. Voyager uses this model when defining interfaces.## Chapter: TimeMore and more people use AI to search for information. But who controls that information? And who shapes the future of AI?Headlines like \"Elon Musk sues OpenAI. They abandoned the mission for profit.\" show that not every technology should be trusted blindly.Voyager offers an alternative: a system where each person can control their own AI agent \u2014 or choose not to use one at all. The freedom of choice here is built on three pillars.## Chapter: Pillars## Pillar 1: The Voyager AgentIts source code is intentionally simple \u2014 to allow any user to modify and develop it. The Agent can be a local application, terminal interface, or a service cooperating with AI. It has a low entry threshold, encouraging experimentation and personalization.## Pillar 2: Voyager-DataBox & Voyager-AppThe DataBox is a canister on the ICP network that stores data about available services and other DataBoxes. It acts as a decentralized directory, which can also reference Voyager-Apps \u2014 independent applications operating as canisters on the ICP network, offering specific functions. Both forms are controlled by users, DAOs, or can be left without active governance. This creates a fully decentralized web of references.## Pillar 3: Communication InterfacesEvery canister operating in the Voyager system declares the supported interfaces \u2014 known as \u201cconnectors.\u201d These are recorded in a special metadata field (e.g., connector[]). These interfaces define how the agent can communicate with a given canister. Importantly \u2014 the interfaces are open; any user can create their own, implement it in their application, and use it in the Voyager agent. Since the Voyager system does not store functions but only their names, near-limitless flexibility and expansion of the system is possible \u2014 without central intervention.## Chapter: The AllianceWe want to build a new system of communication between clients and services.A system that will be:decentralized,open,freedom-based from the ground up,independent of its creators.To achieve this, the community must understand how Voyager works \u2014 so that together we can develop it.## Homework:Reflect on what features connect the Voyager pillars with the earlier technological examples (AI, Tor, HTML)? This is the first step toward understanding a new internet paradigm.# ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Voyager: Build Your Own Internet**Elevator Pitch:** Voyager is a decentralized service discovery protocol that enables machines and people to communicate freely in an open, censorship-resistant network. We're not building another app. We're laying the foundation for the next generation of the internet, where users, not corporations, define the rules.---## The Problem: Trapped in Walled GardensThe current internet is broken. Our data is locked away in the silos of Big Tech. Innovation is stifled by monopolistic APIs and app stores. We are dependent on central servers that can be shut down, censored, or hacked at any moment. Creators and users are at the mercy of platforms that dictate terms and extract value.## The Vision: An Open Horizon for Services and DataImagine an internet where:-   **Services can \"talk\" to each other directly**, without intermediaries or API gateways.-   **Your note-taking app can discover and integrate with a new, decentralized file storage service on the fly**, without waiting for an official integration.-   **Autonomous AI agents can discover, negotiate, and consume services on your behalf**, creating a dynamic, automated marketplace.This is the world Voyager is building.Voyager is a framework, not a finished application. It's a set of simple, open components that allow anyone to create their own \"node\" in the network.1.  **Voyager-DataBox:** A canister running on the Internet Computer (ICP) that acts as your personal, decentralized service catalog. It stores information about your applications and other DataBoxes you know, creating a web of trust.2.  **Voyager Applications:** Any application (web, mobile, CLI, AI agent) that communicates with the world through a DataBox.## Key Innovations That Change the Game### 1. Human-Driven Communication StandardsIn Voyager, there is no central authority dictating API standards. If you want to create a new way for services to interact, like a \"decentralized-nft-market:0.1\", you simply define it and start using it. Your application announces its support for this standard, and others can immediately discover and use it. This is bottom-up innovation in its purest form.### 2. AI-Native by DesignVoyager was designed with artificial intelligence in mind. Service data is structured and machine-readable. This means AI agents can autonomously:-   **Search the network** for services with specific parameters.-   **Understand how to use them** by reading their declared standards.-   **Execute tasks** without needing any graphical user interface.This is the foundation for a true Machine-to-Machine (M2M) economy.### 3. True Decentralization and Data OwnershipBy running on the Internet Computer, every DataBox is a sovereign entity.-   **Censorship-Resistant:** There is no central point of failure to shut down.-   **Data Sovereignty:** You control your DataBox with your Principal ID. Your data, your rules.-   **No Gatekeepers:** You don't need permission from Google, Amazon, or Apple to create and publish your service.## Market PotentialVoyager targets several growing markets:-   **Web3 and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks):** We provide the missing piece\u2014a universal service discovery protocol.-   **The AI Agent Economy:** We are the base layer for autonomous agents that need a reliable way to interact with the world.-   **The Open Internet:** We offer an alternative for developers and users tired of the limitations of current platforms.## Our Hackathon GoalWe aim to demonstrate the power of Voyager by building a simple yet powerful use case: **a decentralized network of assistant agents** that can find and aggregate information from various independent services (e.g., weather, news, simple text-based games) running in the Voyager ecosystem.**Join us on the journey to reclaim the internet. Let's build an open, intelligent, and truly decentralized world together.****cheese**[https://files.catbox.moe/qe8m9b.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/qe8m9b.mp4)",

It uses **Bitcoin** as the primary currency and **ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)** for smart contract logic and the user interface. The innovation lies in enabling flexible \"micro-scholarships\" and \"micro-loans,\" managed by **smart contracts**, which can be released in stages (e.g., after completing a module or passing a course), thereby incentivizing student engagement and success.---**Problem It Solves:**- **Limited Access to Educational Funding:** Many students, especially in emerging economies, lack access to traditional bank loans or sufficient scholarships.- **Bureaucracy and Centralization:** The process of donating and receiving scholarships is often slow, bureaucratic, and relies on intermediaries who charge fees.- **Lack of Transparency:** Donors often lack visibility into how their funds are truly used and whether they reach the intended beneficiaries.- **Inflexibility:** Traditional scholarships and loans are rigid, failing to adapt to a student's progress or changing needs.---**How ICP and Bitcoin Fit In:**- **ICP (Internet Computer Protocol):**    - **Smart Contracts (Canisters):** These will be the platform's backbone, managing the logic for donations, fund allocation, installment releases, student progress tracking, and loan terms.    - **On-Chain Hosting:** The user interface (frontend) and all backend logic can be hosted directly on ICP, ensuring the platform is truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, and always available.    - **Scalability and Speed:** ICP offers the necessary performance to handle a high volume of transactions and user interactions.- **Bitcoin DeFi:**    - **Native Bitcoin Integration:** ICP has direct integration with the Bitcoin network, allowing ICP smart contracts to interact with Bitcoin transactions natively. This means donors can send Bitcoin directly to smart contracts on ScholarFlow, and students can receive Bitcoin securely.    - **Security and Liquidity:** Bitcoin is the most secure and liquid cryptocurrency, making it an ideal asset for educational donations and funding.    - **Global Access:** Bitcoin enables cross-border transactions without intermediaries, facilitating donations from anywhere in the world to students anywhere in the world.---**Key Differentiators:**- **Total Decentralization:** Without centralized servers, the platform is more resilient to failures and censorship.- **Transparency:** All donations, allocations, and fund releases are recorded on the blockchain, making them publicly auditable.- **Flexible Micro-funding:** Allows donations of any size and fund releases based on educational milestones.- **Direct Connection:** Donors and students interact more directly, with fewer intermediaries.- **Gamification Potential:** Fund releases tied to milestones can be gamified, further incentivizing students.",

These NFTs act as verifiable, self-owned digital credentials, providing a strong sense of achievement and encouraging continued effort.*\"Practice Tokens\" (Fungible Tokens) for Effort & Engagement:*Students earn fungible tokens for consistent effort, time spent on practice, and daily micro-tasks. These tokens provide immediate rewards, making routine practice more engaging and incentivizing continuous participation.*Decentralized Learning Portfolio*: All earned NFTs and learning milestones are recorded on a blockchain, creating a tamper-proof, student-owned, lifelong record of their learning journey and achievements.*Community-Driven Learning & Peer Feedback (DAO elements)*:The platform encourages active participation through peer feedback and collaboration, potentially evolving into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where the community can shape the learning experience.*\"Earn-to-Learn\" Mechanics*:Tokens and NFTs can unlock premium content, customize user experiences, or even offer pathways to real-world educational opportunities, further incentivizing deliberate practice.The solution acknowledges the broad 6-18 age range by suggesting modular and differentiated features tailored to the developmental stages of elementary, middle, and high school students.

Any user can instantly launch a token, upload content, and sell directly to their audience. Every sale sends USDC directly to the creator and triggers a buy-and-burn of their token, aligning earnings with long-term value.We\u2019re giving creators financial independence through instant payouts, tokenized ownership, and transparent economics\u2014all without middlemen.---### **Technological Innovation**Signed Trade leverages the Solana blockchain to offer instant settlements, ultra-low fees, and scalable token creation for every creator.Unlike traditional platforms where royalties sit idle and fees eat into earnings, our protocol routes value directly to creators while rewarding their token holders in real time.Each token is launched using our custom built bonding curve, letting creators grow their coin as they grow their audience. Content sales not only generate income, they strengthen the token economy.**ICP-Powered Secure Content Delivery**To ensure content is delivered safely and only to rightful owners, Signed will use the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to host and serve token-gated content. Content uploaded by creators will be encrypted and stored on ICP\u2019s decentralized storage.When a user attempts to access the content, a token verification check is performed to confirm they hold the corresponding creator token. If verified, the content is decrypted and streamed to the user, ensuring end-to-end access control without relying on centralized servers or intermediaries.This allows creators to:- Securely serve token-gated content like music, videos, and digital downloads- Retain full control of their IP, even after it\u2019s uploaded- Reduce the risk of leaks or unauthorized distribution- Enable \u201ctrue ownership\u201d of access rights tied directly to token holdingWe believe this makes ICP a perfect match for our mission to empower creators with ownership, security, and transparency.---### **Platform Features**Signed Trade redefines creator monetization with a simple, powerful toolkit:- **Instant Token Launches:** Create a free coin instantly using your X account.- **Content Sales with Value Capture:** Sell videos, music, art, and more\u2014buyers pay 110%, with 100% to creator and 10% used to buy & burn your token. (direct buy if on bonding curve)- **New Royalties for Creators:** Creators earn 1% on every trade during bonding curve, and post graduation. All in SOL so there is no need to sell their own tokens.- **Real-Time Markets:** Each creator\u2019s token grows dynamically with content sales.- **No Platform Cuts:** Creators keep 100% of sale price. Our protocol sustains itself through external tax.- **Low Graduation Requirement:** Creators only need to raise 30 SOL in order to graduate.- **Meteora Partnership:** We are using Meteora DAMM v2 for LP's post graduation. We have a partnership with the Meteora team to help push this launchpad with the Meteorite Collective. - **Referral Curve System:** Users who refer creators share in fee revenue from that creator\u2019s bonding curve. This comes out of the platforms 1% fee, splitting it half with the referral .5% each. No fee comes out of the creators pockets.- **Token-Gated Content with ICP:** Content is encrypted and served only to verified token holders via ICP, ensuring true ownership and secure delivery.**Upcoming Features:**- **Vault Support for Creator Earnings:** Autopilot reinvestment and savings options for creators using their token revenue.- **Music Distribution to all DSPs:** Direct distribution to all digital streaming platforms for musicians. Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, etc.---### **Roadmap****Short-Term Goals:**- Launch in August onto Mainnet- Roll out multi-format content support (music, video, PDFs)- Expand analytics for token performance and buyer engagement**Long-Term Vision:**- Introduce governance tools for tokenized creator communities- Support cross-chain token creation and settlement- Enable creator DAOs and fan co-ownership structures---### **Why Signed Trade?**Creators today are trapped in systems where value leaks, through fees, delays, and lost ownership. Signed Trade flips that model on its head. We give creators the power to earn instantly, grow their audience into a market, and build real value around their work.This isn\u2019t just a launchpad, it\u2019s the beginning of a new creator economy.",

A major issue is the lack of accessible and organized information regarding career paths, colleges, and courses. This often leads students\u2014especially from rural or underserved areas\u2014to make uninformed decisions based on peer pressure, societal expectations, or limited exposure. The absence of proper guidance or counseling services further increases the chances of choosing misaligned educational or career options, resulting in long-term dissatisfaction and career mismatches.Despite the availability of thousands of institutions and diverse academic streams, the process of selecting the right path remains overwhelming. Students frequently struggle to find reliable data on college rankings, entrance exams, course requirements, and future job prospects. The lack of a centralized and user-friendly platform compounds this confusion.SolutionEdu Navia aims to bridge this critical gap by providing a comprehensive, student-centric digital platform.

It redefines SaaS.Internet users (and future AI agents) lost control over their apps in cloud era due to SaaS. An app may be up-priced, hacked, blocked, undesirably updated, gone bankrupt. Apps installed with my package manager cannot be removed or updated without user's consent - While the user pays for hardware, the app works.Another reason, why this is good to developers, is that it frees the developer from the need to do any DevOps: The developer just creates a repository and an installation link.IC Pack will also provide a standard for \"events\" and \"permissions\" between apps.I have also shipped the first useful app for IC Pack - Payments Wallet. Payments Wallet is distinguished by configurable threshold of payments requiring extra user's confirmation, to protect the user from erroneous accidental payments. Payments Wallet will also provide in-app payments for IC Pack. The wallet has Invest tab, allowing users to invest into IC Pack. This wallet is superior over other ICP wallets by installing it into a user's canister, hindering the wallet provider (e.g. a dev or a DAO) from cheating (e.g. stealing user's funds) by substituting wallet's canisters content. For the wallet the following features are not yet finished: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana payments, displaying a QR code. In-app payments are not standardized, yet.In a future version, I will give the user option for an app to do in-app payments up to a certain amount without asking user.Here is feature comparison of IC Pack with other ways to install apps:[Feature comparison to other ways to install apps.](https://docs.package-manager.com/features-comparison/)Unlike Google Play we support installing apps from multiple repositories. (It is anticipated that every developer creates their own repository.) There is provided a bootstrapper of the package manager that helps to install the package manager and partially installed package manager to finish its own installation. There is a simple API for installing package manager together with a third-party app, so app authors will advertise our package manager together with their apps.By a sophisticated way of programming, the canisters of the package manager are well-protected against non-returning-function DoS attack. By a sophisticated way of programming, during bootstrapping partly installed package manager installs itself.We are going to make money charging 10% of paid apps prices (paid apps and  paid app updates have been implemented), 5% of hardware costs and 3% of in-app payments.Economic breakdown: An average SaaS company (our potential customer) has revenue $15M/year (we expect to take like 5% of such a customer's revenue) and there are 17K SaaS companies in the US only.## Pitchdecks- **[Short pitchdeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1785x43WFogY83qJ4KUgOHNm-q1TXT6Zo/view?usp=drive_link)**- **[Long pitchdeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s1fA-VElPk_bVQsvCpTfqReOmf2lu220/view?usp=drive_link)**Canister IDs:`cxtct-7iaaa-aaaad-aammq-cai``hzopp-yqaaa-aaaad-aamqa-cai``d25g5-qaaaa-aaaad-aamla-cai``cqseh-sqaaa-aaaad-aamma-cai`",

It connects BTCFi projects\u2014such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, decentralized stablecoins, and staking protocols\u2014and their users with expert risk assessors and Bitcoin liquidity providers.Insurance involves buyers paying premiums to protect against specific risks for a defined period. Underwriters assume these risks, earning premiums if no claims occur. If a loss event happens, underwriters compensate buyers up to the policy limit, supported by actuarially calculated loss reserves.### How Satsurance WorksSatsurance enhances traditional insurance by decentralizing risk management into two distinct groups:#### Demand Side (Cover Buyers)BTCFi projects and their end-users seeking insurance coverage for smart contract vulnerabilities, slashing events, and D&O cover.#### Supply Side (Cover Sellers)Consisting of two core participant groups:- **Pool Managers**: Expert risk assessors, such as white-hat hackers and reputable audit firms like Cantina, who evaluate risks, set premiums, and provide at least 10% first-loss capital. They are incentivized by earning 10% of collected premiums.- **Liquidity Providers**: Bitcoin holders who stake BTC into insurance pools, trusting Pool Managers to effectively handle risks and optimize returns.### Economic ModelCover buyers pay annual premiums ranging between 2% and 4% of their coverage amount. Satsurance earns a 15% commission from premiums, distributing the remaining 85% to cover sellers.Cover sellers maintain BTC as loss reserves (at least 10% of coverage underwritten), benefiting from leveraged yields. After Pool Managers deduct a 10% fee for their risk management services, liquidity providers typically achieve yields of 10%-20% APY.",

    "Team description": "PriceLint is a decentralized price prediction platform inspired by [Predictoor.ai](http://predictoor.ai/).In the past, the use of deep learning models to predict prices was always in the hands of a few institutions.Now, with IC's low-threshold service, we can enable everyone to build their own customized models for price prediction and forecast their own future.PriceLint combines the features of Canister and Burn frameworks on the chain to achieve a 100% on-chain LSTM prediction model, significantly reducing the dependence of traditional prediction models on local computing resources.Key features include:- One-click deployment of multiple prediction Canisters- Selection and customization of AI models- Token pledging for predicting ICP, BTC prices- Open trading of user-created AI modelsThe expected probability of a token's price rising or falling is 50%, and using AI prediction models, we can increase this probability. If the probability increases to 55%, it means that there were 50 profits and 50 losses in the original transaction, and now there are 55 profits and 45 losses.This has been validated in [Predictoor.ai](http://predictoor.ai/).Using such prediction results will greatly increase the trading profits of all subscribers.The result is a self-sustaining, decentralized data marketplace, where crowdsourced intelligence is harnessed to train more effective models for 24-hour price trends.Users benefit from supporting, running, or trading model outputs, while the Data Farmer stream provides predictive data for subscribed traders.## \ud83d\udcac User Story---**Data Farmer X** logs into PriceLint, deploys dozens of Canisters with a single click, and tests the accuracy of ICP price predictions by adjusting different model parameters.Select models with an accuracy rate of over 50% for predicting the rise and fall of tokens, submit predictions, and stake a certain amount of tokens. When the prediction is correct, they make a profit; When predictions are incorrect, they incur losses. This promotes the accuracy of predictive information, as only accurate forecasters can make profits and sustain operations.**X** starts optimizing model parameters, improving accuracy, and sharing configurations to the platform market to earn additional profits.**Trader Y** pays to purchase all the predicted aggregates of **X**, and then uses them to perform buy or sell operations. The more accurate the prediction, the easier it is for them to make money, and the more motivated they are to continue purchasing predictive information, thanks to their profit through trading.## \ud83d\udcdd Future plans ---#### Token EconomyExpected to use PCL as a platform tokenStarting from a certain period of time, a round of predictions is made by the data farmer stamp token, who submits their own model to predict the rise or fall of ICP and BTC prices. If the prediction is correct, a reward is earned. If the prediction fails, the staked token is lost.Traders pay PCL to subscribe to forecast data as a reference for their own trades.PCL can be used to some extent as collateral for the user's cycles of running a canister.PCL holders vote to determine the allocation of reward pools and platform upgrades.The trading market allows users to share their AI configurations, allowing other users to perform copy operations and earn copy rewards. Users can also sell their own AI configurations, and the platform will charge a 2% -5% transaction fee.#### \u200b\u200bEstablish a Decentralized Data MarketplaceWe hope to establish a suitable predictive model trading platform.Through the low threshold AI model training channel provided by PriceLint, users can easily train their own AI models and trade freely in the trading market for profit.And users submit results by pledging tokens.

    "Team description": "**1. Introduction**![logo2.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/1983fff84d52c78ce6701bf4ba69d90b.png)DynastyChesses is an innovative GameFi strategy game that merges the grandeur of Chinese historical dynasties with immersive chess-based warfare mechanics. The game offers players the chance to build and lead their own civilizations, strategize in epic battles, and explore a deep cultural narrative. By blending traditional Chinese cultural elements with modern blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, DynastyChesses aims to create an unparalleled GameFi experience.![\u914d\u56fe2.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/19840027d7bf245392039764d9da8383.png)The game draws inspiration from famous Chinese philosophers like Shao Yong(\u90b5\u96cd), who connected the principles of chess to broader themes such as life, war, and governance. His philosophical insights into the relationship between human action (\u4eba\u9053) and the greater order of nature (\u5929\u9053) deeply resonate within the game\u2019s strategic design.DynastyChesses goes beyond traditional games by offering a platform where players can actively engage in historical events and reflect on key philosophical ideas related to leadership, decision-making, and the impact of human actions on the larger world. This approach not only enhances the educational value of the game but also creates an immersive and thought-provoking experience for players worldwide.**Core Vision**DynastyChesses envisions delivering a highly immersive and intellectually challenging strategy game that celebrates Chinese history and culture. The game\u2019s foundation rests on two pillars:1. **Cultural Integration**: Drawing from the rich historical legacy of Chinese dynasties and their philosophies.2. **Blockchain & AI Technologies**: Using blockchain (ICP chain) to provide transparency and decentralization, while AI enhances player engagement through dynamic, adaptive gameplay.The overarching goal of DynastyChesses is to create a long-term sustainable GameFi ecosystem that goes beyond financial incentives, focusing on creating lasting player engagement through deeply enriching gameplay and cultural narratives. The combination of strategic depth, historical accuracy, and modern gaming technology ensures that DynastyChesses stands out in both the GameFi and strategy game markets.**2. Market Overview****2.1 The GameFi Landscape**The GameFi sector has gained significant attention in recent years, largely driven by the integration of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) into gaming. GameFi combines financial incentives, such as play-to-earn mechanics, with gaming to allow players to earn cryptocurrency or NFTs (non-fungible tokens) while they play. However, many GameFi products have struggled to retain long-term player engagement due to their heavy focus on financial mechanics over genuine gameplay.DynastyChesses addresses this gap by creating a **gameplay-first experience**, driven by deep strategic elements and meaningful cultural narratives, ensuring both short-term excitement and long-term player retention. While DynastyChesses incorporates blockchain-based play-to-earn mechanics, it places greater emphasis on historical and cultural immersion, offering players more than just financial rewards.In recent years, the GameFi sector has been expanding rapidly. The number of blockchain gamers has grown from approximately 1 million in 2020 to more than 5 million in 2023, with projections showing continued growth. Analysts predict that the blockchain gaming market will surpass $25 billion by 2025, creating immense opportunities for new, innovative projects like Dynasty Chess.Moreover, the rising popularity of strategy-based games, particularly those with historical themes, provides additional market opportunities. Games like **Civilization**, **Total War**, and **Crusader Kings** have enjoyed global success due to their complex gameplay and educational elements, further indicating the demand for intellectually stimulating gaming experiences.**2.2 Target Audience**DynastyChesses targets three key groups of players:![\u914d\u56fe4.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/198400568b0d9aad15667e6483093d2a.png)1. **Strategy Enthusiasts**: Fans of complex strategy games such as **Civilization**, **Total War**, and **Age of Empires**, who enjoy deep tactical challenges and decision-making.

They specialize in guerrilla tactics and subversion, using shadowy magic to confuse and disorient enemies.- **Ghosts (\u9b3c)**: Stealthy and elusive, Ghosts excel at ambushes. They can pass through solid objects and remain hidden from sight until they strike.Each mythical race introduces new mechanics that challenge players to think outside the box. Whether using divine magic to obliterate enemy defenses or relying on stealth tactics to outmaneuver stronger foes, these races add depth and variety to the core gameplay.**3.3 Generals System**DynastyChesses features a unique **Generals System**, allowing players to command legendary historical figures from Chinese history. The game includes 120 iconic generals, each with their own skills and attributes that influence battle outcomes. Generals such as **Zhao Yun** and **Li Shimin** have special abilities that can change the tide of battle, offering players strategic advantages when deployed correctly.Each general comes with a detailed backstory, giving players insight into their historical significance. Additionally, players can upgrade their generals by completing specific missions or participating in special events. As generals gain experience, they unlock new abilities, making them even more formidable on the battlefield.Generals are not just military leaders; they also serve as cultural ambassadors. Players can learn about each general\u2019s historical context, achievements, and leadership style, blending education with entertainment. The inclusion of legendary figures such as **Sun Tzu**, **Cao Cao**, and **Liu Bei** enhances the historical depth of the game, while also providing strategic depth as players must carefully choose which generals to deploy in different scenarios.**3.4 Authentic Battlefield Maps**DynastyChesses recreates several historically significant Chinese battlefields, providing players with an immersive strategic experience. Each map is meticulously designed to reflect the terrain and conditions of famous battles, such as:- **The Battle of Red Cliffs**: Players must navigate the treacherous river terrain and utilize naval units to gain the upper hand. Control of the waterways is key to victory in this iconic Three Kingdoms-era battle.- **The Siege of Xiangyang**: A map designed around urban warfare, where players must balance defensive fortifications with aggressive siege tactics.The game\u2019s dynamic maps introduce a new level of complexity, requiring players to adapt their strategies based on the unique features of each battlefield. In some cases, players may need to defend narrow mountain passes, while in others, open plains provide opportunities for large-scale cavalry charges. These varied environments encourage players to think critically about positioning, unit composition, and timing.**4. Technological Integration****4.1 ICP Chain Integration**DynastyChesses leverages the power of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) chain to ensure that all strategic calculations and image rendering are decentralized and executed directly on the blockchain. This approach ensures that gameplay remains **fair, transparent, and secure**, with every move recorded on the blockchain. The use of ICP technology also enhances the game\u2019s performance, allowing for **real-time calculations** without the need for centralized servers.The blockchain integration provides several key advantages:- **Decentralized Ownership**: Players have full control over their in-game assets, including generals, units, and NFTs.

The transparent nature of blockchain technology guarantees that all moves are verifiable and tamper-proof.- **Community-Driven Development**: Through decentralized governance, players can vote on new features, updates, and game mechanics. This approach fosters a strong community and ensures that the game evolves in line with player expectations.The integration of ICP technology also enables **cross-chain compatibility**, allowing DynastyChesses to interact with other blockchain networks. This opens up new possibilities for collaborations, partnerships, and cross-platform events, further expanding the game's reach.**4.2 AI Opponent System**The game employs cutting-edge AI to power its opponent system. Each AI general can dynamically adjust its strategies in real-time, learning from the player\u2019s decisions and adapting to new tactics. This AI system ensures that every match remains challenging, even for experienced players.The AI is programmed to mimic the strategic thinking of actual historical generals, making each game feel like a real battle of wits. For instance, when facing an AI-controlled **Cao Cao**, players may find themselves outmaneuvered by surprise attacks and rapid troop deployments, reflecting Cao Cao's historical military tactics.DynastyChesses also integrates AI learning algorithms to provide a more personalized gameplay experience. As players engage in multiple matches, the AI adjusts its difficulty level based on the player\u2019s performance, ensuring that both novice and expert players are consistently challenged.**5. Revenue Model**DynastyChesses is designed with a diverse and flexible revenue model that ensures sustainability while providing a fair experience for both free-to-play and paying players. The game offers a wide range of monetization options that enhance the player experience without compromising the core gameplay. Key aspects of the revenue model include:**5.1 Premium Generals and Special Maps**- **Unlocking Legendary Generals**: Players can unlock premium generals by purchasing them or completing special missions. These generals not only offer unique gameplay benefits but also have rich historical backstories, which enhances the cultural depth of the game. For example, unlocking a legendary general like **Zhuge Liang** allows players to gain access to advanced tactical abilities and special bonuses.- **Historic Battlefield Maps**: Players can purchase access to specific historic battlegrounds, each offering unique strategic challenges and environmental conditions. These maps provide opportunities for more experienced players to test their skills in realistic, dynamic environments.Offering premium content, such as legendary generals and specialized maps, allows DynastyChesses to monetize without relying on pay-to-win mechanics. Players are encouraged to invest in additional content that deepens the gameplay experience and offers new challenges, rather than giving them an unfair advantage over others.**5.2 Dynasty and Mythical Race Unlocks**- **Paid Dynasties**: While 4 dynasties are freely available, the other 8 require payment to unlock. Each dynasty brings its unique strategic advantages, military units, and architectural designs, allowing players to experience a wide range of playstyles.- **Mythical Races**: The 8 mythical races, such as the **Gods**, **Immortals**, and **Demons**, are available for purchase. Each race offers entirely new abilities and units, significantly expanding the game\u2019s variety and complexity.**5.3 NFT Integration**- **Generals as NFTs**: Players can collect generals as NFTs, with each NFT representing a unique, tradable asset.

Existing solutions, such as **Dropbox**, **IPFS**, and **BitTorrent**, fall short in different ways\u2014whether it\u2019s centralized control, block-level limitations, or lack of data consistency mechanisms.Our proposed solution is a **decentralized lattice storage system**, designed to provide a comprehensive and scalable alternative. The **Data Lattice** offers a **universal data model** that supports all data formats\u2014such as **graphs, vectors, binaries, JSON**, and more\u2014enabling flexibility in building advanced distributed applications. Unlike **IPFS**, which is **block-level** and focuses on breaking files into immutable content-addressable blocks, Data Lattice can manage **complex data types and entire data structures** as cohesive units, ensuring **eventual consistency** across nodes through Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (**CRDTs)**. This allows for seamless updates, replication, and efficient handling of high-performance, large-scale applications requiring **real-time consistency**.We chose the Data Lattice approach because it inherently supports diverse data models, scalability, and **self-sovereignty**, ensuring that data ownership remains with users while addressing the performance needs of modern decentralized applications. In contrast to **Dropbox**, which is centralized, Data Lattice provides a **self-sovereign, decentralized file system** (DLFS), combining the accessibility of Dropbox with the decentralization of **BitTorrent** and **IPFS**. Its support for **P2P content delivery** allows for efficient data distribution without central authority, enhancing **privacy and autonomy** for users.

    "Team description": "# It Is Not A Trading Bot, It Is Your Portfolio Manager## Product Roadmap OverviewOur ultimate mission is to enable decentralised finance applications anywhere, starting in regions where crypto adoption is slowed by regulation or weak infrastructure. We pursue a hybrid architecture that respects local compliance while offering Web3-native features through ICP's chain fusion capabilities and canister smart contracts.## \ud83c\udf0d Focus AreasWe categorise our roadmap into two primary directions:- **Local Market Features** \u2013 Tailored for emerging markets (like Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and South Africa) where crypto is often treated as a threat to fiat sovereignty. These features comply with local regulations and provide licensed, regulated access to financial tools through ICP's secure canister infrastructure.- **Global Web3 Features** \u2013 A separate track focused on DeFi-native tools, like on-chain credit, automated market makers, DAOs, and yield aggregators, all powered by ICP's chain fusion technology.## \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec Local Market FeaturesIn many local markets, a typical crypto wallet raises red flags. Instead, we built a licensed, compliant investment layer using ICP canisters that enables modern fintech use cases without violating local laws. This wallet is regulated-first, non-custodial, and rules-enforced through ICP's deterministic smart contracts.### \ud83d\udcb0 Regulated Coin InfrastructureThink of our Regulated Coin system as a programmable fiat wrapper built on ICP. Apps can integrate it seamlessly through ICP canisters to manage fiat inflows and outflows, similar to how Robinhood or EA Sports handle in-app purchases and redemptions.You set your conversion ratio (e.g. 1:1 = 1 Regulated Coin = 1 EGP). We handle:- Fiat custody through licensed partners via ICP HTTPS outcalls- On-chain minting/burning through ICP canister functions- Real-time KYC/AML compliance using ICP's secure computation- Transaction approval via our ICP-based Rules Engine### \u2699\ufe0f Dynamic Rules EngineEvery on-chain action passes through a modular Rules Engine deployed as ICP canisters, tailored for your license class.Each canister module enforces specific transaction conditions, like:- **Stock Broker Canister**: Enforces investor registration, only allows transactions involving licensed securities, and requires investor KYC.- **E-Commerce Canister**: Applies tax policies, VAT rules, and regional restrictions.- **Banking Canister**: Adds anti-money laundering (AML) checks powered by AI running on ICP, and enforces withdrawal limits or suspicious activity flags.### \ud83d\udce6 Modular DesignThe Rules Engine canisters are upgradeable through ICP's canister upgrade mechanism. For example:- When a fintech app launches as a broker, only the Broker Canister is deployed.- Once the app obtains an Asset Management License, it deploys the Asset Manager Canister, unlocking new capabilities (e.g. pooled investment, auto-rebalancing, treasury APIs).## \ud83e\uddea Use Cases### \ud83e\uddfe 1. Thndr (Stock Broker \u2013 Egypt)- Thndr starts with a brokerage license deployed on ICP.- They set a 1:1 EGP to Regulated Coin ratio managed by ICP canisters.- Initially, the Rules Engine includes only the Broker Canister: investors must be KYCed and only buy licensed instruments.- Later, Thndr secures an asset management license. A new canister is deployed, enabling pooled portfolios, managed funds, and basket investing\u2014all on ICP, all regulated.**Benefits:**- Fully compliant fiat-to-Web3 rails via ICP- Real-time fund flow for local stock purchases through ICP HTTPS outcalls- Built-in traceability and AML enforcement via ICP's transparent blockchain### \ud83d\udecd 2. Local E-Commerce Platform- A Shopify-like platform adds the Regulated Coin SDK powered by ICP canisters to enable customers to pay in EGP Regulated Coin.- The E-Commerce Canister auto-applies sales tax, bans restricted goods, and complies with import/export limits.- Fiat is held in custody until delivery is confirmed, and only then settled to the merchant through ICP smart contracts.**Benefits:**- Faster, traceable payments with built-in regulatory checks via ICP- Cheaper than cards or mobile wallets through ICP's low-cost transactions- No licensing burden on the store \u2014 we handle that through ICP infrastructure### \ud83c\udfe6 3. Local Bank or Neobank- A bank issues digital wallets for its users with embedded Regulated Coin support through ICP canisters.- The Banking Canister scans every transaction for AML patterns using AI models running on ICP.- Users can send EGP tokens between accounts, pay bills, and request loans, all under the bank's compliance umbrella managed by ICP smart contracts.**Benefits:**- Fully licensed on-chain banking rails via ICP- Real-time fiat tokenization and redemption through ICP canisters- Programmatic controls on all money flows via ICP's deterministic execution## \ud83c\udf1f Key Benefits- **Zero On-Chain Fees** \u2192 Improve retention with fee-free transfers via ICP's reverse gas model- **Real-Time Settlement** \u2192 No delays in deposit/withdraw cycles through ICP's fast finality- **DeFi-Like UX** \u2192 Enable instant loans, on-chain equity, and smart investments via ICP canisters- **Chain Fusion Interoperability** \u2192 Your tokens can interact with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains through ICP's chain fusion- **Regulatory Protection** \u2192 No need for your app to obtain a license\u2014we cover it through ICP-based regulated custodians- **Compliant by Design** \u2192 Rules Engine enforces all AML/KYC/jurisdictional rules at the canister level- **No Backend Ops Needed** \u2192 All infrastructure runs on ICP canisters with automatic scaling- **Custom Rules Per App Type** \u2192 Banks, brokers, e-commerce, and fintechs can all tailor their compliance canisters- **Support for Regulated Coin Lifecycle** \u2192 Mint, use, and burn tokens with full control and auditability via ICP## \ud83d\udd04 How It Works (Step-by-Step)1. **User Sends Fiat**: Customer sends local currency (e.g., EGP) to a wallet-linked bank account verified by ICP HTTPS outcalls.2. **Minting Regulated Coin**: The ICP canister confirms fiat receipt, locks the reserve, and mints an equivalent amount of EGP Regulated Coins.3. **Rules Engine Check**: Before any on-chain transaction is approved, the Rules Engine canister reviews the user's KYC status, transaction type, jurisdiction, and app license.4. **In-App Usage**: The user can now purchase stocks, pay for services, or invest based on the app's licensed capabilities managed by ICP canisters.5. **Withdrawal Process**: When users redeem tokens, ICP canisters burn the Regulated Coin and release fiat back to their account via HTTPS outcalls.**Platform Profitability**: Your platform earns yield on fiat float, enjoys high user retention, and avoids costly payment infrastructure through ICP's efficient canister model.## \ud83d\udce6 Funds Orderbook### Tokenised Access to Local Investment FundsTo empower individuals to invest in regulated fund products, we offer fund certificates as NFTs on ICP, each representing a unique investor position. This on-chain representation opens the door to a new wave of financial innovation, including instant loans, yield delegation, and programmable asset management through ICP's chain fusion capabilities.### \ud83e\uddea Sample Use Case: Daily Money Market Fund In EgyptImagine a fund like B-Secure with a stable daily yield. If it is available on ICP, users have their position represented as an NFT. We can support more advanced features like instant loans, delegate yields for other funds, for example, coupling 50% with 50% deposit to a more risky fund.Take a fund like B-Secure, which offers a stable, daily yield. With our ICP-powered system:- Investor deposits fiat (EGP) verified by ICP HTTPS outcalls- Receives an NFT certificate on ICP representing their position- Gains access to advanced features like:    - Instant liquidity via NFT-backed loans through ICP canisters    - Yield delegation (e.g., 50% to charity, 50% to a higher-yield fund) via ICP smart contracts    - Participation in secondary markets through ICP's chain fusion## \ud83c\udf1f Key Benefits- **Programmable Financial Products**: Unlock advanced DeFi-like functionality such as NFT-collateralized loans, yield redirection, and automated reinvestment strategies through ICP canisters- **On-Chain Compliance**: All investor verification and KYC/AML flows are integrated and recorded on ICP's transparent blockchain- **Streamlined Settlement**: Orders, approvals, and NAV-based settlements are handled transparently and efficiently via ICP smart contracts- **Zero Fees**: All interactions (minting, transfers, loan requests, delegations) are gasless through ICP's reverse gas model## \u2699\ufe0f How It Works (Step-by-Step)1. **User Deposits Fiat**: The investor sends EGP to a fund-specific wallet (custodial account managed by ICP canisters).2. **User Submits Investment Order**: The investor specifies the fund and amount via the ICP-powered app or SDK.3. **Fund Ops Team Reviews Order**: The order is reviewed for approval by ICP canisters, ensuring regulatory and fund-specific constraints are met.4. **Order Lock-In Before Dealing Period**: Approved orders are locked in ICP canisters until the next dealing window (e.g., daily, weekly).5. **NAV Calculation & Settlement**: During the dealing period, ICP canisters calculate the latest Net Asset Value (NAV) and execute settlements.6. **NFT Certificate Issued**: An on-chain NFT is minted on ICP and issued to the investor's wallet, representing their position.7. **Post-Investment Features**: With the NFT in hand, users can request instant loans backed by their investment, delegate their yield to other products or causes, and trade the position in a secondary market through ICP's chain fusion.## \ud83c\udf0d Global Market FeaturesIn global markets, users expect seamless digital experiences similar to CeFi platforms\u2014but with the benefits of non-custodial wallets and DeFi. Our approach? AI Wallet Agents powered by ICP canisters and Internet Identity, offering automation, yield optimization, and multi-chain execution through ICP's chain fusion while keeping users in control.## \ud83e\udd16 Wallet Agent Consultant FeatureThink of it as a CeFi-like experience with DeFi ownership. Your users can interact with their non-custodial wallets through a personal AI agent running on ICP\u2014one that manages savings, monitors yield opportunities, and automates investment strategies across protocols and chains through ICP's chain fusion capabilities.These agents are deployed as ICP canisters with Internet Identity authentication and trained to optimize every aspect of digital asset management, including gas fees, risk exposure, and multi-chain operations via ICP's chain fusion.### \ud83e\uddea Sample Use Case: Long-Term Investments + AutomationImagine a freelancer or remote worker receiving stable monthly income in crypto.Their ICP-powered Wallet Agent performs the following:- Buys ETH through ICP's chain fusion when gas is low and price is favorable- Diversifies the rest into stablecoins via ICP's multi-chain capabilities- Allocates stablecoins across selected DeFi vaults through ICP's chain fusion- Offers re-staking strategies for compounding yield managed by ICP canisters- Provides regular performance feedback, alerts, and suggestions through ICP's reliable messagingAll without leaving the ICP-powered wallet interface.## \ud83c\udf1f Key Benefits- **Automated Multi-Chain DeFi**: Agents identify yield opportunities across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains through ICP's chain fusion\u2014executing at optimal timing and costs- **Modular Strategy Subscriptions**: Instead of tokenized positions, users subscribe to proven strategies deployed as ICP canisters. Strategy creators earn a percentage of profits managed by ICP smart contracts- **Fiat Gateway Optimization**: In crypto-restricted jurisdictions like Egypt, the agent picks the best fiat off-ramps through ICP HTTPS outcalls based on speed and cost- **Multiple Wallet Management**: Users can control wallets from different chains\u2014all coordinated through one ICP-powered agent with Internet Identity- **On-Chain Performance Monitoring**: ICP canisters offer live performance updates, notify users of market trends, and suggest reallocation or exit points- **Charity Integration**: Users can automate donations from yields to registered charities or DAOs through ICP's transparent smart contracts- **NFT Collector Intelligence**: For collectors, the ICP agent monitors collections across chains via chain fusion and executes purchases within preset price ranges## \u2699\ufe0f How It Works (Step-by-Step)1. **User Sets Strategy**: The user talks to the AI agent running on ICP, defining investment goals: retirement savings, yield farming, NFT collecting, or charity yield delegation.2. **AI Agent Monitors Wallet Activity**: ICP canisters track deposits (e.g., salary) and market conditions in real time across multiple chains via chain fusion.3. **Automated Execution**: The ICP agent buys assets (ETH, Bitcoin, stablecoins) at optimal prices through chain fusion, deposits into liquidity vaults or staking platforms, and diversifies across chains with optimal routing.4. **Yield Monitoring & Rebalancing**: ICP canisters monitor yield performance, network conditions, and DeFi protocol health across chains. They rebalance positions automatically or after user approval.5. **Performance Feedback**: Regular reports are sent to the user with performance summaries and recommendations generated by ICP canisters.6. **Optional Modules**: Users can activate optional ICP canister modules for fiat conversion via jurisdiction-aware gateways, NFT collector mode, and automated charitable giving.",

Model/key storage and management2. User-specific data processing and model deployment### ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)Handles cross-contract calls for token transfers and payment verification, ensuring secure financial transactions within the system.## User Types and Interactions### User A (Model Publisher)- Participates in Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the Backend for AES encryption- Uploads encrypted models and corresponding keys to Calimero- Receives aggregated values and reports from the system### User B (Model Trainer)- Models are securely fetched to user's local machine- Training occurs in the Model/Model.py file- Interacts with Backend for model verification## Technical Implementation### Model Publishing Flow1. Publisher initiates Diffie-Hellman key exchange2. Backend validates and processes the AES encryption3. Model and keys are uploaded to Calimero4. System confirms successful publication### Model Training Process1. Trainer receives encrypted model2. Local processing on trainer's machine3. Results verification through Backend4. Integration with Calimero infrastructure### Access Control1. Users make token payments from the Cross Contract call2. ICP verifies transactions3. Access granted to Model key4.
